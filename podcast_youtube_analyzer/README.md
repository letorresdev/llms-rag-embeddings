# Podcast Summary Tool

## Motivation
I regularly watch podcasts on YouTube, particularly those focusing on economics and its impact on technology and AI. Recently, I've fallen behind on keeping up with these valuable information sources. This tool aims to help me efficiently process and extract key insights from these podcasts.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Content Extraction
1. Extract transcripts from YouTube videos
2. Convert transcripts to Markdown format
3. Highlight important information automatically

### Phase 2: Content Summarization
1. Generate s doc by summarizing key points from the processed transcripts
2. Support multiple podcast sources using their YouTube IDs

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage
- **Vector Databases**: Not required for initial implementation
  - Current focus is on processing recent content rather than historical retrieval
  - Emphasis on quality of extraction rather than storage
  - No immediate need for long-term storage as content is time-sensitive

### Pipeline
- Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process focusing on:
  - Reliable transcript extraction
  - Accurate content summarization
  - Efficient posting workflow

## Future Considerations
- Evaluate need for content storage based on user feedback
- Possible integration with other social media platforms
- Automated content tagging and categorization
