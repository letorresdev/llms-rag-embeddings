[0:00] all right everybody welcome back to this

[0:01] weekend startups I'm Jason kelanis an

[0:03] angel investor and podcast host here in

[0:06] Austin Texas I used to say Silicon

[0:08] Valley last year now I say lost in Texas

[0:11] and with me my co-host Alex wilh how are

[0:15] you sir I am fantastic we have an

[0:17] amazing rundown today yes and we also

[0:20] have Nvidia earnings after the Bell uh

[0:23] that's going to come out of course after

[0:24] we record this Jason but I am just

[0:26] bursting with excitement I mean this is

[0:28] going to be I think a urgency report

[0:30] that really sets the tone for the next

[0:32] couple of months he going to tell people

[0:33] where we are on the bullishness hype

[0:35] cycle for AI so I'm kind of counting

[0:37] down the minutes right now until Jensen

[0:39] tells us if there's going to be

[0:41] Christmas in technology or just coal in

[0:43] our

[0:44] stockings this weekend startups is

[1:28] twist to book a demo and get a $75 gift

[1:31] card so let's just get into it they're

[1:34] expected to report $33 billion in

[1:37] Revenue yeah if you put that number

[1:39] times four h you get to a $130

[1:44] billion a year um and the data SE the

[1:49] data center revenue is 29 billion of

[1:51] that if you didn't know Nvidia used to

[1:53] be a company that made graphic cards for

[1:57] gaming that was basically their business

[2:00] that's what they were known for if you

[2:01] were a video game nerd you would sit

[2:03] there and you'd buy an Nvidia card if

[2:06] you wanted to get your frame rate up

[2:07] when you were playing a desktop game

[2:10] somewhere along the line people took

[2:12] those gpus graphical processing units

[2:14] and started using them for

[2:16] cryptocurrency so then they had two line

[2:19] items and cryptocurrency I think for a

[2:21] time you know was driving the stock

[2:24] those two little businesses that was

[2:26] their Tam total addressable market and

[2:28] we're going to talk about Tam a lot

[2:30] because I just saw a great clip of Bill

[2:32] Gurley talking about him I think maybe

[2:33] we'll put that for tomorrow but that's

[2:35] an industry term for hey what's the

[2:38] market size you're going after and you

[2:41] can do all kinds of fun things once you

[2:43] know the Tam The Tam of gaming in the

[2:46] Tam of

[2:47] crypto well you can kind of figure out

[2:50] what the total addressable Market is how

[2:52] many customers there are how much

[2:54] they're willing to spend and then you

[2:56] can do interesting things like who has a

[2:59] certain percentage of the market and

[3:01] then how much is the market growing Year

[3:03] over-year and that can give you some

[3:05] ideas of where the company's going why

[3:08] is this so

[3:09] flawed Alex when it comes to looking at

[3:13] Nvidia at that time I know we're going

[3:16] to get to the Uber example tomorrow but

[3:17] I'll just kind of tease it for everybody

[3:19] one way to think about Uber back in the

[3:21] day but before it was big when it was

[3:23] small was to look at the taxi market and

[3:25] say okay the taxi Market is xll Uber

[3:27] will get 30% of it so it's new ceiling

[3:30] is y do the thing is a really good

[3:33] product makes the market much larger

[3:36] Uber made the taxi Market larger iPhone

[3:38] made the smartphone market larger Etc so

[3:40] if you have a technology that breaks out

[3:42] for example Nvidia gpus in the data

[3:44] center context you can suddenly go from

[3:46] a company doing a couple of billion a

[3:48] quarter to dozens of billions a quarter

[3:51] right and I call this Market

[3:53] manifestation uh and I got that term

[3:58] from induced traffic you know I remember

[4:01] when I lived in Los Angeles they would

[4:03] always be adding a lane to a highway

[4:06] they'd be like hey you know what the 405

[4:08] it's getting a little congested here at

[4:09] the 405 and the 10 let's add some bigger

[4:11] off ramps and they did these spectacular

[4:14] off ramps and I remember reading about

[4:16] it Alex these were going to change

[4:18] everything these off ramps instead of

[4:20] one lane getting off in a tight tur uh

[4:23] turn they were going to have two lanes

[4:27] and they were going to be a giant wide

[4:29] turn onto Wilshire Boulevard or Olympic

[4:32] or Santa Monica Boulevard so when you

[4:34] got off the 405 instead of having you

[4:36] know this little quarter mile circle of

[4:38] one lane with 10 cars in it uh let's say

[4:42] 20 cars in it you would have you know a

[4:45] mile with 40 cars in two lanes you'd

[4:48] have 80 cars getting off instead of 20

[4:50] you went from 20 cars getting off to 80

[4:52] and that would make the traffic flow

[4:54] because you could get more cars off

[4:55] quicker into that queue to get on to

[4:57] Santa Mar bouard you know what Happ yeah

[5:01] but people started to realize hey track

[5:04] down the 405's been easy breezy maybe

[5:06] I'll buy a house a little deeper into

[5:08] the valley get a little more bang for my

[5:10] buck because hey the 40 minute commute I

[5:14] can go an extra exit or two out and it's

[5:16] kind of reasonable so I'll get the

[5:17] cheaper HS or hey you know what I love

[5:20] this restaurant in Santa Monica I live

[5:22] in the valley or I'm in Venice and I

[5:23] want to go to a restaurant in Clover

[5:25] City yeah I'll zip across and uh go to

[5:27] that restaurant it would induce more

[5:29] traffic and it never

[5:31] ended so that's what Uber did in this

[5:33] example though

[5:34] Nvidia became the choice

[5:37] for doing large language models at

[5:40] inference I guess on the margins as well

[5:43] and these h100 CH uh servers just

[5:46] started doing bigger and bigger machine

[5:48] learning tasks large language models

[5:50] come out and suddenly everybody in the

[5:52] tech industry sitting on mountains of

[5:54] cash

[5:56] realizes hey we can't buy anything so

[5:58] here's the other trend right the wrath

[6:00] of KH which is coming to an end the

[6:03] wrath of Lena KH said no m&a that means

[6:06] all those cash builds up nobody's buying

[6:08] Whole Foods nobody's buying you know

[6:10] what's that so what are you gonna do

[6:11] with the money you might as well build

[6:13] some servers you might as well stand up

[6:15] a server Farm it's good use for it maybe

[6:17] a stock buyback and that's when 29 of

[6:21] the $33 billion that Nvidia is expected

[6:24] to announce tonight is going to come

[6:26] from data

[6:27] centers just let that sink in 90% of

[6:30] their revenue now comes from a a a

[6:33] product or a business line which was not

[6:35] really on the top of people's minds but

[6:38] five to 10 years ago correct oh

[6:40] absolutely and uh Court can we get that

[6:41] table back up on the screen for a second

[6:43] because I want to make a make a point to

[6:44] underscore what Jason is saying here

[6:46] which is that the the scale of nvidia's

[6:49] Revenue I think kind of udes or hides

[6:51] how quickly it came to be because you

[6:52] hear that number you think okay well how

[6:54] much revenue does Apple do or does

[6:55] Microsoft do whatever but Jason if you

[6:57] look at this chart just observe the jump

[7:00] from the first quarter of their fiscal

[7:02] 24 to the second quarter of their fiscal

[7:04] 24 people not watching the video uh

[7:06] nvidia's data C Revenue went from 4.3

[7:09] billion to 10.3 billion in a single

[7:12] quarter and then it went to 14 A2 18 a.2

[7:15] 22 and a half 27 and then today much to

[7:18] be 33 that is still accelerating Jason

[7:21] it's still getting much bigger very

[7:22] quickly and that's why I think this

[7:25] earnings report matters so much there's

[7:26] a lot of enthusiasm right now in the

[7:28] market in a post Trump context next the

[7:30] lenon tenure is coming to an end there's

[7:32] still a lot of investment hype and a lot

[7:34] of excitement about what's going to come

[7:36] The Vibes are good in other words yeah

[7:39] and I think that Nvidia will either

[7:40] maintain that or really hurt it ah so

[7:43] give me the case for herting The Vibes

[7:47] what could

[7:48] cause um you

[7:51] know the stock to tank what could cause

[7:54] people to lose Faith what would be the

[7:57] narrative or the plot

[8:00] or The Vibes that can make people go you

[8:02] know what maybe this is overhyped and

[8:06] coming to an end yeah so I think two

[8:09] things there one if the company just

[8:11] meets expectations like I believe we saw

[8:13] in the preceding quarter we could see it

[8:15] stock drop five six points again people

[8:17] are expecting a beat this is a company

[8:19] that is valued on growth it's expensive

[8:21] by a couple of traditional metrics

[8:23] people really believe in it so it's

[8:24] being valued as such the reason why I

[8:27] think it could harm The Vibes if it

[8:28] misses just barely meets expectations is

[8:31] that that implies quite a lot about the

[8:33] rest of the industry nvidia's quarter to

[8:36] quarter Revenue numbers Jason are a

[8:38] proxy for the investment that big tech

[8:40] companies the hyperscalers are putting

[8:42] into their data centers which are a

[8:43] proxy for market demand for AI models AI

[8:47] inference and essentially just the

[8:48] health of the AI economy so nvidia's

[8:50] kind of down the pipe a little bit but

[8:52] it should tell us what's going on

[8:53] upstream and it's one of the best

[8:55] indicators we have so that's why I think

[8:57] it matters so much for the the software

[8:59] picture if that makes sense Founders do

[9:02] you want to sell to bigger customers I

[9:03] know you do you got to get that ACV

[9:05] trending up and you want to push your

[9:08] churn down right sounds good but to sell

[9:10] to those big buyers you need to clear

[9:13] all of these compliance checks you know

[9:15] that that means you got to have things

[9:17] like sock 2 sorted out what's sock 2

[9:20] it's a standard and ensures that

[9:21] companies keep their customer data safe

[9:24] and if you are in sock to compliant you

[9:26] can kiss those big deals goodbye you're

[9:28] not going to land the lighthouse

[9:29] customer you're not going to be able to

[9:30] operate at the highest end of the market

[9:33] but vanta makes it really easy for you

[9:35] to get and renew your stock to

[9:37] compliance on average vanta customers

[9:39] are compliant in Just 2 to four weeks

[9:41] can take months without vanta and they

[9:43] automate compliance for gdpr Hippa and

[9:46] more so you can sell to beer customers

[9:49] in whatever markup your startup is going

[9:51] after vanta is going to save you

[9:52] hundreds of hours of work and up to 85%

[9:55] on compliance costs stop slowing your

[9:57] sales team down and use

[9:59] get $1,000 off at v.com twist that's

[10:02] v.com twist for $1,000 off your sock 2

[10:06] this quarter are they on a fiscal

[10:08] quarter or are they on a calendar

[10:10] quarter I'm curious this is

[10:12] Q3 fiscal 2025 or 2024 am I reading2

[10:17] yeah so this is we're in their fiscal

[10:19] we're in their next fiscal year a bit

[10:20] like Microsoft they're they're offset by

[10:22] a couple quarters got it okay so this is

[10:26] um going to be really interesting we''ve

[10:28] never seen a company GR grow large

[10:30] amounts of Revenue in this way the last

[10:33] quarter was

[10:34] 30

[10:36] billion I'm saying that and uh the year

[10:40] earlier for Q2 was 13 billion so they

[10:43] more than two times their revenue that

[10:46] quarter to that quarter Q3 last year 18

[10:50] billion this year 32 so it's going to

[10:53] just under double right so this uh crazy

[10:56] growth is slowing but it's still

[11:00] significant and we talked about before

[11:03] on the program there have been a bunch

[11:05] of people looking at Round tripping as a

[11:08] technical era as a technical term for

[11:12] self-dealing or Insider R transactions

[11:16] they invest in a company that company

[11:19] buys

[11:19] servers with uh invidious money but

[11:22] those numbers were kind of small then

[11:24] there's accounting issues when do you

[11:26] recognize Revenue so a lot of the

[11:28] revenue here my understanding is baked

[11:31] in because somebody will put it in order

[11:33] you have a company like x. a Elon X

[11:37] company they bought a lot of h100s they

[11:39] stood them up incredibly quickly okay

[11:41] those all got delivered in a quarter but

[11:44] they probably have future ones coming in

[11:46] and then you have people like Amazon

[11:47] Apple Google and meta probably

[11:50] programmatically buying X number per

[11:53] month my understanding is Jetson's

[11:56] approach is we just take your order and

[11:59] we fulfill orders and the when orders

[12:01] are received but I don't know how the

[12:03] money Works do they get the money ahead

[12:05] of time and they get to sit on it it

[12:07] would seem like they have the unique

[12:09] ability in the world to dictate terms

[12:13] and I wonder if you know how much cash

[12:16] they're sitting on now and what they

[12:20] require in terms of people giving them

[12:22] money in advance to lock in those one

[12:24] could argue that they could give people

[12:27] two options one you put a 10% down

[12:29] payment on you're in the que if you want

[12:30] to be in the VIP Q you you put down a

[12:33] full deposit 100% And you go to that

[12:35] that so I would run the company with two

[12:37] cues that you know whatever 25% down que

[12:41] and then you get stuff after that and

[12:43] then the priority queue which is you you

[12:44] pay a 100% upfront I don't know exactly

[12:47] how they do it so I'm I'm looking

[12:50] through their uh last quarter's earnings

[12:52] because again people were recording this

[12:53] right before the the Q3 fiscal 25

[12:55] numbers but if we'd look at their defer

[12:59] Revenue which Jason I believe is where

[13:01] they would put uh prepaid contracts

[13:04] essentially it's not that much money

[13:07] it's actually um at the end of the last

[13:09] quarter just $1.7 billion worth of

[13:11] deferred revenue so to me that doesn't

[13:14] imply that there's a lot of chicanery

[13:18] going on here and I'll just point out

[13:20] that the investing Community Court if we

[13:22] could have that uh table pulled up real

[13:23] quick the investing Community is not

[13:25] concerned about this uh as you can see

[13:27] from here Nvidia is once again the most

[13:30] valuable company in the world beating

[13:33] Apple beating Microsoft beating alphabet

[13:35] beating Amazon beating a ramco beating

[13:37] meta so while you and I because we're

[13:41] nerds for financial documents are a

[13:42] little concerned about possibilities of

[13:44] round shipping or what to do with the VC

[13:46] fund as you mentioned last time uh the

[13:48] street doesn't care great awesome uh

[13:51] okay so we are going to get those

[13:54] numbers and we'll have a live show

[13:56] tomorrow Thursday because instead of

[13:58] doing Friday show I'm going to be taping

[14:00] all in on Friday so you get your all in

[14:02] on Saturday but we moved up this week

[14:04] and started up to Thursday so I don't

[14:05] have to tape two episodes in one day

[14:07] which is exhausting for me one a day is

[14:10] great it's like a workout two a day too

[14:12] much whenever I do two records in one

[14:14] day I walk into the house afterwards and

[14:16] my wife's like what's wrong and I'm like

[14:17] I had to talk for three hours and she's

[14:19] like oh you poor

[14:22] thing very tiring well it's mentally um

[14:27] stimulating uh you and I get to have a

[14:29] conversation here but Allin sometimes

[14:32] tips in from uh just a conversation to

[14:35] just outright sparring and in a cage

[14:37] match especially if things like Ukraine

[14:39] come up or Trump or whatever political

[14:42] discussion so for me this is like a

[14:46] delightful conversation that can become

[14:48] a little bit Yeah spicy let's say and

[14:52] then try on that one I'm the moderator

[14:54] here you get to play a little bit more

[14:55] of the moderation role and I get to kind

[14:57] of shoot a little bit more here to your

[14:59] point guard and we do the pick and roll

[15:00] over there I'm doing a little more Point

[15:01] guarding which is also exhausting yes

[15:05] it's much harder people have asked me do

[15:07] you prefer to be a panelist or a

[15:09] moderator and the answer is so obvious

[15:12] being a panelist is great you show up

[15:14] with your shoes untied you sit down

[15:15] someone puts a mic in your ear right you

[15:17] shoot right easy they Passat you the

[15:20] ball you shoot yeah man coming down the

[15:22] court having two guys double team you

[15:24] and you're trying to zip around and get

[15:26] somebody open and you have to keep your

[15:28] entire peripheral vision open hey where

[15:30] are the opportunities here for other

[15:32] people to score takes a lot of work all

[15:34] right so that's Nvidia yeah let's move

[15:37] on uh anything else we should be looking

[15:39] for there or anything notable or just

[15:41] we'll talk about it tomorrow when it

[15:42] comes we'll talk about it tomorrow I

[15:43] think that's enough on that because

[15:44] we'll get the numbers we'll do a better

[15:45] Deep dive but that's that's the the

[15:47] state of play uh at for 4M today you're

[15:49] on the live stream okay Jason by the way

[15:52] the number one thing I want to know just

[15:53] as a project here is when does Nvidia

[15:56] have a competitor this is my big

[15:59] question when do we think there'll be a

[16:02] disruptive competitor and you'll see a

[16:06] leading this is what I'm looking for

[16:08] okay a

[16:10] leading uh company a leading customer

[16:12] one of their Lighthouse customers let me

[16:14] say it that way when will One of

[16:15] nvidia's Lighthouse customers that's a

[16:17] technical term in our industry for a

[16:19] customer so pronounced that other people

[16:23] are guided to your product because of it

[16:25] like a lighthouse guides people to Sure

[16:27] safely having xai or having open AI or

[16:31] having Amazon web services as your

[16:33] customer that would guide other people

[16:34] to the safety of an h100 in invidious

[16:37] term so when does a lighthouse

[16:40] customer flip to another product okay

[16:43] that's what I'm looking for that will be

[16:46] the disruptive moment we should all be

[16:47] looking for with Nvidia and it will come

[16:50] first in the in the in the form of an

[16:53] announcement then there'll be a

[16:55] startup um that tries it and gets a lot

[16:58] of attention for doing it and then

[16:59] there'll be a competing cloud computing

[17:01] offering so look for that little cohort

[17:03] that's when you know the Nvidia story is

[17:06] going to have complications yeah well

[17:09] one I mean just to pick a Twist 500

[17:11] company etched they're making ships that

[17:13] are literally purpose-built for the

[17:15] Transformer architecture for llms which

[17:18] is a wager by the way on that

[17:19] maintaining its Primacy in how AI models

[17:22] are built but I love it because if

[17:24] they're correct they're going to be a

[17:25] huge company and could to your point

[17:27] Jason snag some real market share

[17:29] um I don't think we'll see hyperscalers

[17:32] stop buying Nvidia chips altogether but

[17:35] I so I would amend your what to look for

[17:37] by saying when does they when does a

[17:39] lighthouse customer for NVIDIA start to

[17:41] buy large amounts of a competing chip um

[17:45] and of course Amazon has its trainum two

[17:46] chips coming out so there is some other

[17:48] names on the agenda uh Jason before we

[17:50] get to a guess though I want to talk

[17:51] about uh AI training and and data

[17:54] because there's a little bit of news

[17:55] here from The Twist 500 and it's that I

[17:58] don't think we actually got to this on

[17:59] the show but Tobit one of two companies

[18:02] that we added that are dealing with

[18:03] building a Marketplace between content

[18:05] providers and AI models that want to use

[18:07] that data uh raised a series a a $24

[18:09] million series a quite large and they

[18:12] said as part of that that they have

[18:14] customers they have data and they have

[18:16] ai companies on the platform so progress

[18:18] there pretty good and then also pr. a

[18:22] new company to me backed by Mayfield uh

[18:24] just secured $130 million valuation um

[18:27] because it's doing the same thing the UK

[18:29] a yes pra being your share of something

[18:36] and your ability to buy those shares in

[18:38] the future that's the the term we use

[18:40] here in the valley so fair compensation

[18:43] and credit for Content owners in the age

[18:44] of AI so this is not pra as in you get

[18:48] if you own 10% of a startup you get to

[18:50] buy 10% of the next round this is

[18:53] compensation for contentor this is

[18:54] amazing we need to have attribution we

[18:57] need to have citations EX exactly as I

[18:59] had said on this very program I think

[19:02] two years ago at some point citations

[19:05] will be required and permission will be

[19:07] required citations are in the latest

[19:10] version of chat GPT everywhere

[19:13] perplexity has always had some of them

[19:16] and in the new search product that uh

[19:18] chat GPT or I'm sorry open eyes doing

[19:21] their search feature they have some

[19:22] citations some of them are buried some

[19:24] aren't so um I think this is what we're

[19:27] seeing is the healthy evolu ution of the

[19:30] ecosystem and what's going to have to

[19:32] happen is the untraining of models so if

[19:34] you put Reddit in your model when you

[19:37] build your next version uh you're going

[19:40] to need to make sure that all that

[19:41] content from Reddit is taken out somehow

[19:44] technically that might

[19:46] mean you know yeah I

[19:49] mean how do you do that it's a it's a

[19:52] technical question I'm not sure how much

[19:56] how much of a new version of chat GP he

[19:58] relies on what was index previously and

[20:01] so yeah I don't know the answer to that

[20:05] I know in some models they just start

[20:06] over they have all the data sitting

[20:08] there so then it would just be like it

[20:10] would be the equivalent of having a

[20:12] library and going in and saying okay

[20:13] take all the Stephen King books down

[20:15] take all the token ones down we don't

[20:18] have the rights to those take them out

[20:19] of the library now open the library to

[20:21] customers but if all the knowledge was

[20:24] already sucked in and it's got it in

[20:26] there I don't know how you Rick rip out

[20:28] that scaffold thing that's a really good

[20:29] question for when we have these

[20:31] companies on the Pod one thing I'd like

[20:33] to Institute here if somebody is good

[20:34] enough to be on the twist 500 let's have

[20:36] the founder on the Pod for a quick guest

[20:39] hit twist 500 is our attempt to identify

[20:42] the top

[20:43] 500 private Market companies now an easy

[20:46] way to do that would be to just look at

[20:48] market caps and put in all the unicorns

[20:51] we're not doing that there you can sort

[20:54] the twist 500 which is built on Koda

[20:57] coda.io twist I think and you get some

[20:59] sort of free deal we didn't pick them

[21:01] because they're a sponsor on this

[21:02] podcast um we did because it's a really

[21:05] great tool for doing stuff like this but

[21:06] it's a database you can go in there how

[21:09] many companies are we at right now we

[21:10] are at about 110 and uh due to a snafu

[21:14] I'm re adding in about another 10 so

[21:15] we'll be about 120 all right going

[21:18] slower than I would like but uh maybe

[21:20] this will be our cue for end of the year

[21:22] project is to is to ramp up here

[21:24] somebody had a baby and I think has been

[21:26] having a little less sleep so we've also

[21:29] been doing a lot of shows I mean oh

[21:31] that's true we have been hitting four or

[21:33] five shows in a week which I never

[21:35] thought was going to happen um but next

[21:38] year it's going to be three shows a week

[21:39] the sales team hates me because I'm

[21:43] turning down money for that fourth fifth

[21:46] show a week but I just you know I want

[21:48] to do three really high quality shows a

[21:50] week let's get that dialed in and then

[21:53] maybe we can both get some sleep all

[21:54] right let's we know we have a speaking

[21:56] of guests yes uh and you can check out

[21:58] twist 500 twist 500.com goad check it

[22:01] out there's a submission form there

[22:02] don't email the sales team and ask them

[22:04] to put you on the twist 500 people

[22:06] selling the ads if you go through them

[22:09] it's probably going to be worse for you

[22:11] that will be like a minus one because we

[22:12] have a Chinese wall a fire wall between

[22:15] the editorial and the ads you don't get

[22:16] to be on the twist 500 because you

[22:18] advertise okay but there is a submission

[22:20] form and I don't think anybody reads it

[22:22] but there's a submission uh it goes to

[22:25] one of my email addresses I believe so I

[22:27] will see it Founders know that every

[22:30] missed call is a missed opportunity

[22:32] customers don't want to wait they will

[22:35] call someone else if you don't pick up

[22:37] but if you use open phone you're never

[22:39] going to miss another customer call and

[22:41] guess what it's super affordable and

[22:43] easy to use people used to spend tens of

[22:46] thousands hundreds of thousands of

[22:47] dollars putting in a corporate phone

[22:49] system and now for just $15 a month open

[22:52] phone will give you a business phone

[22:54] line and complete control of your

[22:56] destiny want to know who answering

[22:58] customer calls and how they were handled

[23:00] open phone can do incredible things like

[23:02] sync with HubSpot and give you AI

[23:05] powered call summaries automated

[23:07] responses to ensure you don't miss a

[23:08] single ring well that's all built into

[23:10] open phone and if you've got an existing

[23:12] phone number they will let you port it

[23:14] over at no extra charge get 20% off your

[23:17] first 6 months what an amazing offer at

[23:20] open phone.com Twist that's OPN P ne.com

[23:25] twist for 20% off for 6 months

[23:29] let's talk about our our first guest

[23:30] today sure there's a company Jason

[23:31] called Allen Control

[23:33] Systems they caught my eye on Reddit

[23:36] because I like things that go boom and

[23:38] then it turned out that they are a

[23:39] venture back startup and raise money I

[23:41] believe from Craft ventur so I thought

[23:42] hell let's Happ on best David saxs back

[23:45] this company I remember we had a

[23:46] conversation on Allin last year or maybe

[23:49] two years ago we were talking about

[23:51] would you back a company and I remember

[23:53] Shack kind of waffled a little bit at

[23:55] the qu at the at the answer of the

[23:56] question and then I found out he

[23:58] actually had but he hadn't announced it

[24:00] yet and Steve uh is here uh welcome to

[24:03] the program Steve hey thanks for having

[24:05] me on guys appreciate it all right I

[24:07] think you might remember that moment

[24:08] maybe because yeah I do remember the

[24:10] moment also uh it's good to see you

[24:12] again Jason I briefly saw you at the

[24:13] all-in summit I was hanging with mostly

[24:15] Jimmy though your guy Jimmy ah oh J oh

[24:18] Jimmy Donahue my my we're gonna we're

[24:21] gonna golf together we're golf we're

[24:22] about really Jimmy D is the greatest

[24:25] Jimmy D and I grew up on the same Block

[24:26] in Brooklyn we had the same crew he went

[24:29] on uh with my brother to join the NYPD

[24:32] the three of us were going to go on at

[24:34] the same

[24:35] time right as I was about to join

[24:39] NYPD I got accepted to forom at the last

[24:42] minute and I went at night and uh there

[24:44] is where like the uh changing cars the

[24:47] the the butterfly effect whatever

[24:50] happened and yeah Jimmy's the man Jimmy

[24:52] is the guy and he does all my security

[24:55] and is awesome uh so tell us a little

[24:57] bit about your company what are you

[24:59] trying to do here and uh I mean fun

[25:02] fundamentally we're trying to change the

[25:04] battlefield economics um so Allen

[25:07] Control Systems we make autonomous gun

[25:09] systems and so these are guns that can

[25:11] point and shoot uh on their own so the

[25:14] operator the the soldier only has to

[25:16] give a command of what Target they want

[25:18] and then bullfrog as you see here will

[25:21] actually do do the rest it'll it'll slew

[25:23] to the Target and then fire the

[25:25] shot wow and it is an actual ual um

[25:30] assault rifle it looks like yeah that's

[25:32] been mounted so you don't make the gun

[25:35] you use an existing gun in the world

[25:37] correct yeah so we're using a standard

[25:39] m240 assault rifle it's a standard it's

[25:41] a standard Army uh gun that's in you

[25:43] know most uh units it's a very widely

[25:45] distributed gun yeah got it so you don't

[25:48] have to worry about the maintenance of

[25:50] those guns or building them they exist

[25:53] in the world already is that a 50

[25:54] caliber on this one I'm seeing here

[25:56] that's still the m240 if we do have a 50

[25:58] Cali variant coming so what we make is

[26:00] the we make all the steel like we cut

[26:02] all the steel we make all the circuit

[26:04] the motherboard the motor control board

[26:05] all the circuit cards are custom and

[26:07] then the software everything but the gun

[26:09] basically yeah well because you know

[26:10] when I did my tours Alex H Stolen Valor

[26:14] I uh I used to man the 50 in in my

[26:16] dreams I man the 50 my my my my like

[26:19] Cuba Gooding Jr in that one movie Pearl

[26:21] Harbor man in the 50 cal yeah I used to

[26:23] man that 50 I think also Blackhawk down

[26:26] there were yelling man the 50 and John

[26:28] mckuin my good friend who was a Green

[26:30] Beret he used to man the 50 caliber um

[26:32] all right so you have this um existing

[26:36] assault rifle you build a container for

[26:38] it and then it has a lot of AI and this

[26:41] is not used to go out and kill humans in

[26:44] the field this is used for defensive

[26:47] purposes today correct yeah so we are

[26:49] starting with the hardest problem which

[26:51] is hitting a fast moving small drone um

[26:54] obviously it is a it is a gun system so

[26:57] you know the Army will use it for for

[26:58] multiple Mission sets but drone Warfare

[27:00] is the primary uh concern right now I

[27:02] I'm really curious about just the sheer

[27:04] volume of these because I've actually

[27:06] shot um machine guns before uh once at

[27:09] West Point for example and they are just

[27:11] so indescribably loud and so I'm kind of

[27:14] curious does that at all Impact how you

[27:16] Design Systems to go after drones

[27:17] because I presume you want to be

[27:19] stealthy until you pull the trigger but

[27:20] oh my God once you do Stephen they're

[27:23] just insane yeah that's a good point so

[27:25] our system is designed to be passive

[27:27] meaning it's using cameras to find the

[27:30] drones so instead of a radar detection

[27:32] system which is very loud the enemy can

[27:33] see like someone using Active Radar and

[27:35] then they can set hit an artillery shell

[27:37] to your truck our system with just the

[27:39] cameras you know before you fire the

[27:41] shot you can hide and so the passive

[27:43] nature of it is really good for Force

[27:45] protection okay and then does that mean

[27:47] that it's Optical based and if so does

[27:49] that mean that you have issues in rain

[27:51] snow sleep is this a fair weather system

[27:53] I suppose yeah no it should work in all

[27:54] weathers and at night time we use EO

[27:56] electrical Optical and IR sensors so

[27:58] infrared um and so we're we're able to

[28:00] see at night as well um you know

[28:02] obviously if it's really rainy out that

[28:04] can be a problem but that's also a

[28:05] problem for many other weapon systems as

[28:07] well let me ask you a candid question

[28:08] here how long did it take to develop

[28:11] this system just in quarters or months

[28:13] or years I mean this was a solid 18

[28:17] months to get it to where it where the

[28:18] government is buying it now I would say

[28:20] it's another 18 months you know till

[28:23] it's like the best gun on the market

[28:25] that you could buy like it's it's going

[28:27] to be it's already the most accurate gun

[28:29] in the US right now um but it will be

[28:32] incredible you know in another year or

[28:34] two um but yeah like right now 18 months

[28:37] got it so the reason I asked that

[28:40] question is there are bad guys in the

[28:41] world um and if you're a small team uh

[28:45] at a startup can build this in 18 months

[28:48] is there are there versions of this that

[28:51] have been built with by nefarious

[28:53] players terrorist organizations Bad

[28:55] actors in the world that you have become

[28:57] aware of starting the company um not

[28:59] that I'm aware of this is the I I do

[29:01] survey the market pretty often as the

[29:02] startup CEO uh this is the first gun

[29:05] that is putting uh like a one or two

[29:07] like couple bullets on a drone at any

[29:09] like two or three football fields away

[29:11] um so there's nothing like this on the

[29:12] market uh there will be I mean obviously

[29:14] anyone can build anything um this does

[29:16] take a lot of money you know obviously I

[29:18] was fortunate enough to sell my last

[29:19] company to Door Dash which helped fund a

[29:21] lot of the company it was called bbot it

[29:23] was an online ordering point of sale

[29:25] company um actually backed by Craft

[29:27] Ventures so made them some money when we

[29:29] sold that for a good amount of money so

[29:32] you went from point of sale to

[29:35] pinpoint uh yeah sniping well well

[29:39] before um door before the restaurant

[29:41] technology I started my career in the US

[29:43] Navy ah I was I was a US Naval officer

[29:45] and actually Luke Allen my co-founder

[29:47] company's called Allen Control Systems I

[29:48] named it after my my friend um I met him

[29:51] in the Navy so we were we worked in the

[29:53] nuclear um it's called Naval reactors

[29:55] nav co8 so we we were the headquarters

[29:57] for the Nuclear Navy oh wow that's

[30:00] awesome so the uh we I know submarines

[30:04] are powered by small nuclear reactors

[30:07] yes yes so we would Train characters as

[30:11] yeah so we saw we overse saw from Cradle

[30:13] to grave the nuclear reactors on the

[30:15] carriers and the submarines and we

[30:16] trained the fleet on how to operate may

[30:19] I ask a dumb question uh to

[30:22] Steve we have big debates about small

[30:26] modular reactors and safety of

[30:29] them are military uh there are dozens of

[30:33] small nuclear reactors I believe on

[30:37] submarines and aircraft carriers correct

[30:40] today yeah these are these are very

[30:43] powerful you know reactors on the

[30:45] submarine small in the sense of volume

[30:49] they are not the size of the giant you

[30:52] know spherical cones that we see on the

[30:54] landscape these are the size of a

[30:56] conference room or conference rooms how

[30:59] probably like the size of you know like

[31:01] eight conference rooms okay so it's the

[31:03] size of a couple of tractor trailers

[31:05] inside one of these larger things and

[31:07] they are safe has there ever been an

[31:08] instance where one of these dozens of

[31:10] them have had a meltdown and are not

[31:12] safe Naval reactors we would say we've

[31:14] had um in our I guess 75 years of

[31:17] operation no reactor

[31:19] accidents so when you hear

[31:22] people you know hand ringing ketching

[31:26] whatever about

[31:28] nuclear reactors do you just pound your

[31:30] head into your desk I well I'm a strong

[31:33] proponent of large scale commercial

[31:35] reactors I think those are the best I

[31:37] think we need more of those the small

[31:39] modular reactors you know while they

[31:41] they look promising there's a lot of

[31:42] startups doing it it seems safe it's

[31:43] just it's not where I would want to be

[31:45] like if I was investing my money I want

[31:47] to be in the big reactors got it

[31:49] economies of scale econom of scale is

[31:50] just super efficient they can pump out a

[31:52] lot of power like people are just afraid

[31:54] of them from it's a public perception

[31:55] thing um public is a little afraid of

[31:58] them but you can put these in Far Away

[31:59] places and you know run the power so I'm

[32:02] I'm a big reactor guy uh the small mod

[32:04] reactors are still I still think it's to

[32:05] be seen um how they play out uh that's

[32:08] where I'm that's where I stand all right

[32:10] Stephen I want to get back to drones

[32:11] though because we've been talking about

[32:13] Dr talk about any topic by the way we

[32:14] can go I I do my why you're a good guest

[32:17] I got it you want all right so first of

[32:19] all opinions on the new opth album and

[32:22] do you think they'll return to the real

[32:24] death metal roots of the band or do you

[32:26] think they're going to stay prier and

[32:27] more melodic all right you got me I you

[32:29] got me you can't comment on death metal

[32:31] no you got me I mean everyone should be

[32:33] able to

[32:35] comment down so that's me good job all

[33:51] twist Stephen um Dron swarms so we've

[33:54] talked to skyio we've talked to other

[33:56] people that are working on both uh in

[33:58] the air and underwater drones and

[34:00] they're talking a about swarms and when

[34:01] I look at your system super cool love

[34:04] the technology seems to be able to hit

[34:05] single targets is it applicable to drone

[34:08] swarm defense or is it more we're going

[34:10] to get spare reconnaissance drone that's

[34:13] flying over and yeah this is this is

[34:15] meant for a drone swarm so it'll use

[34:17] it'll do coordinated fires so multiple

[34:19] bullfrogs the bullfrog itself can turn

[34:22] 360 degrees and point straight up in the

[34:23] air so imagine if it's on if the

[34:25] bullfrog's on a Bradley tank can do a

[34:28] full protective bubble around the tank

[34:31] and the it shoots very quickly so you

[34:34] know we think we can shoot with one

[34:35] bullfrog up to like 20 drones in under

[34:39] like 15 seconds like it's that fast yeah

[34:42] no and so but it's going to take

[34:43] multiple Bullfrogs and swarms could

[34:45] overwhelm it that is very true I think

[34:47] that we will see like 10,000 drones

[34:50] coming at something you're going to need

[34:51] a lot of guns um and maybe some other

[34:53] layer defense for electronic warfare or

[34:55] something else like that well here's the

[34:57] good news

[34:58] uh these things I'm going to guess I'm

[35:00] going to guess the price here $500,000

[35:02] per uh

[35:04] 350,000 okay I'm Anice by the way firm

[35:07] fixed price not Cost Plus not Cost Plus

[35:10] exactly so I the reason I'm becoming an

[35:13] expert on this because I have a podcast

[35:14] you understand and we had another

[35:16] company on recently that's making uh out

[35:19] of Providence Rhode Island uh unmanned

[35:23] basically Torpedoes um that are only

[35:27] 70,00 compared to like what they would

[35:29] normally cost so you're part of this new

[35:31] generation of instead of doing Cost Plus

[35:33] hey you make it it's got a good margin

[35:35] in it maybe there's a maintenance

[35:36] contract or a software license to you

[35:39] know keep some reoccurring Revenue come

[35:41] in or whatever but the Army can buy 10

[35:43] of these and if you lose five who cares

[35:45] yeah they're disposable at 350 exactly

[35:48] it's a very good price point for them

[35:50] for this kind of exotic technology and

[35:52] yeah we we hope to like I said we're

[35:54] trying to bring that cost curve down

[35:55] it's so important yeah I want back to

[35:57] the Bradley point because Bradley are

[35:59] apcs right not versus tanks the

[36:02] Bradley's the army tank the big army

[36:04] tank I thought that was the

[36:06] ABS uh yeah the Abram well the Abrams

[36:09] and the Bradley I think are both oh

[36:11] anyways I I did not mean to drag us down

[36:13] to nbts versus apcs um but but the point

[36:16] is they're they're mobile so if I had um

[36:19] an infantry division say and I had

[36:21] several different wield or track

[36:23] vehicles I could essentially bring

[36:25] fullon drone defense with me for an

[36:27] entire cohort of troops I presume pretty

[36:31] much any climate so does this negate the

[36:34] the drive we've seen towards more

[36:35] drone-based Warfare versus hum driven

[36:39] Warfare I I think yeah well I think when

[36:42] our product really hits the battlefield

[36:44] which will be soon it's going to uh

[36:47] dramatically change how fpv makers think

[36:49] about their companies um we're about to

[36:51] make them look pretty dumb wait what's

[36:53] an FB fpv drone like a small first

[36:55] person drone like we're going to oh

[36:57] first person these um actually I have

[36:58] one here this right here oh yeah yeah

[37:01] those are like the standard DGI yeah so

[37:03] like these are like you know companies

[37:05] are trying to strap bombs to these and

[37:07] then fly them at artillery or Bradley's

[37:08] yeah Bradley is like the smaller like

[37:10] the Abrams is the bigger tank you're

[37:11] right but the Bradley's like tank like

[37:13] you s one of these with a Grenade on it

[37:15] or something a little bit more uh and

[37:18] you drop it or you comicazi it in right

[37:21] so exactly and so we're going to be

[37:23] neutralizing that threat and I think

[37:25] that the Drone makers are going to have

[37:26] to respond somewh way because it's

[37:28] really hard to you know mitigate a

[37:30] bullet hitting this I was just about to

[37:32] say you can't put armor on that thing

[37:34] cuz one you put enough armor on to

[37:36] negate a 50 cal bullet it's going to be

[37:38] too heavy to fly yeah and two I mean it

[37:40] wouldn't be maneuverable it would be

[37:42] just a brick in the sky so it' be easier

[37:44] to shoot at that point so is there a way

[37:46] for them to like see incoming bullets

[37:49] and then get out of the way we're going

[37:50] to give the drone maker so like there's

[37:51] startups like neros doing drone swarms

[37:53] and then there's Ander just release the

[37:54] bolt have you seen the bolt M it's a

[37:57] yeah the bolt the bolt is their their um

[37:59] cheap fpv by Ander it's it's incredible

[38:02] it's an incredible product um I I

[38:04] actually really like it we're actually

[38:05] doing a test ACS versus andil next year

[38:09] they our bullfrog versus their drone

[38:11] swarms their bolts um nice and so can we

[38:14] pay-per-view this this would be a great

[38:16] we startups pay-per-view yeah here's the

[38:19] bolt yeah the bolt is there is it Super

[38:21] Sonic or no um no it's not super sonic

[38:24] but it's very fast and so this thing is

[38:26] they're going to try to see if they can

[38:28] get through bullfrog and blow up like a

[38:29] cyber truck or

[38:30] something and we'll uh we'll do that

[38:33] competition again I I feel really

[38:35] strongly about how we're going to

[38:36] perform because if you attach any sort

[38:38] of payload to bolt it can't move as fast

[38:41] as it shows in the videos like there's a

[38:43] 4 kilogram or three kilogram bomb on it

[38:46] like it's a Sitting Duck for a bullfrog

[38:47] I think well I think what's going to

[38:50] happen in these cases I'm just going to

[38:51] take a guess here is it's going to be

[38:54] about kind of like the Iron Dome in

[38:56] Israel is

[38:57] it's just what percentage can you take

[38:59] down with the bullfrog and then how many

[39:02] can they send at once and can some slide

[39:05] through so this is just going to be

[39:06] correct me if I'm wrong how many get

[39:08] through the net how many yeah yeah well

[39:11] there there's a couple things we're

[39:12] doing there like um so our company

[39:14] strategy is to make a family of

[39:16] autonomous guns so bullfrog is a a small

[39:19] caliber m240 based we're also building

[39:21] an m30 m134 minigun so it's a Gatling

[39:23] gun version so the Gatling gun can do

[39:25] like 3,000 rounds a minute so imagine

[39:28] coordinated Gatling autonomous Gatling

[39:30] guns I mean we're going to put a lot of

[39:31] lead in the air it will it will cover

[39:33] the sky it is what it is yeah cheap I

[39:36] mean a bullet is cheaper than a drone

[39:38] and a drone's cheaper than most other

[39:39] things in the military world but we're

[39:41] really getting back down to kind of like

[39:42] dollars per kill here yeah and what

[39:44] happened what where we really the

[39:45] Insight really from Luke my CTO the

[39:47] brains behind this is that it's the

[39:49] control systems that's why the company's

[39:50] called Allen Control Systems we just

[39:52] found a way to put a bullet on a small

[39:54] drone at three football fields away yeah

[39:56] and and it was just a very it's hard

[39:57] problem that you know we're we're happy

[39:59] we're very excited right now you going

[40:01] put these on sniper rifles I take it at

[40:03] some point to get people further away um

[40:05] so at the longer ranges what we're doing

[40:07] is a 30 millimeter chain gun so it's

[40:09] like a it's the bushmaster by North up

[40:12] Grumman um my dad actually worked at

[40:14] north of Gman for 33 years so I I grew

[40:16] up around this in the prime contract

[40:18] people in your how many people in your

[40:19] company right now um so we're 35 people

[40:21] uh adding about four Engineers a month

[40:23] right now uh yeah just growing so what

[40:27] did does it say about our military and

[40:31] our ability to compete in the world when

[40:33] we take capitalism

[40:36] entrepreneurship and unleash it on the

[40:39] military industrial complex what does

[40:42] this mean for our ability to be the most

[40:47] important military in the world yeah I

[40:50] think this actually a really I think

[40:52] about this a lot this question because

[40:54] if if you didn't have the background me

[40:56] and Luke had and then you hadn't sold a

[40:58] company for a lot of money you wouldn't

[41:00] we wouldn't have been able to like get

[41:01] the capital to build this product and I

[41:03] think this is a huge problem in the US

[41:05] right now so there's a lot of smarter

[41:06] people than even me and Luke that are in

[41:08] universities that have great ideas like

[41:09] bullfrog but they can't even really get

[41:12] started to like help the military with

[41:14] these new Innovations because the

[41:15] capital uh constraints to get in like

[41:17] the amount of CeX You Need Is So High um

[41:20] so it kind of I think we're missing out

[41:21] on a lot of new type of weapon systems

[41:23] that we should be building and the

[41:25] government's not Capital allocating into

[41:26] like new innovation like that that much

[41:29] so like without I I don't really know

[41:30] what the us would have done without like

[41:32] the situation Luke and I just found

[41:33] ourselves in to able to do this we do

[41:36] have uh the Venture industrial complex

[41:40] and I think the Venture industrial

[41:42] complex combined with entrepreneurs

[41:44] taking on the military industrial

[41:46] complex or at least

[41:48] creating uh a little bit of competition

[41:51] on the margins is going to be

[41:53] transformative and if you look at any

[41:55] top- down government dictatorships I'm

[41:58] referring to they can move quickly

[42:00] because they can enslave a million

[42:02] people put them into factories like the

[42:04] Chinese are doing with Wagers and say

[42:06] hey make a bunch of sneakers or drones

[42:09] or you know landmines they can do

[42:12] whatever they want but that Pals in

[42:15] comparison to The Innovation and the

[42:17] drive of free men and women and

[42:21] capitalism that's why we are going to

[42:23] win and I agree 100% last thing on that

[42:25] is just that Venture capitalists and

[42:26] this this is like one area where like

[42:27] they're really bailing out the

[42:28] government to be honest like without

[42:30] without the VC Community we would be

[42:32] really far behind our enemies for the

[42:34] Venture Capital Community this is

[42:38] exactly who should be doing it because

[42:41] it's risk Capital designed for awards

[42:43] and designed to build better products

[42:46] and services than exist if the

[42:49] government were to award

[42:51] those people at MIT or you know whatever

[42:56] engineering school

[42:58] with just a grant they would not move as

[43:00] fast than a company run by you or pomber

[43:03] luuy or Elon or you know pick your great

[43:06] entrepreneur because they wouldn't have

[43:08] the drive and the competitive nature and

[43:12] that is what is missing from government

[43:15] allocation and capital

[43:17] allocation is a competitive sport it's

[43:20] one of the great underappreciated things

[43:23] people like David Sachs are competing

[43:26] against Sequoia competing against white

[43:28] combinator our firm we're all competing

[43:31] to get deals the founders are creating a

[43:34] Marketplace for us to compete for deals

[43:37] and pay the highest price you know and

[43:39] and to keep the stock price growing all

[43:41] that's part of Great American capitalism

[43:46] which at its core is competitive it's

[43:49] very competitive we're I'm a very I'm

[43:51] I'm a big competitor yeah that's why

[43:54] you're able to do this in 18 months if

[43:57] you were working at a school and you had

[43:58] self- selected

[44:00] into a a university Academia the people

[44:03] giving out grants you would not have the

[44:06] urgency of doing it in 18 months it's

[44:07] the fact that you were going to run out

[44:08] of money in month 24 that made it get

[44:11] delivered in 18 you need the pressure

[44:13] need it I'm curious about the uh the the

[44:15] manufacturing element about this because

[44:16] we're talking a lot about American

[44:18] Capital American Ingenuity American

[44:20] defense um is the supply chain entirely

[44:22] domestic and is that possible and then

[44:24] also manufacturing how domestic is that

[44:26] yeah we're going to be doing this all in

[44:28] America um it's mostly uh currently in

[44:31] America and the thing is like right now

[44:33] this appropriation I do a lot of the

[44:34] lobbying I live in DC and I do a lot of

[44:36] besides fundraising I do a lot of the

[44:37] lobbying and Hill work so we're working

[44:39] with um Congress right now to decide

[44:40] where we're going to put you know some

[44:41] of these buildings I mean this is great

[44:43] by the way Alex because you and I talk

[44:45] here all the time on this weekend

[44:46] startups about Job destruction Americans

[44:50] who are out there you were thinking you

[44:51] were going to work in the marketing

[44:53] department or Communications or whatever

[44:55] your degree is maybe even a developer

[44:58] you know maybe you need to actually go

[45:00] to a factory and assemble something in

[45:02] the real world and that's going to

[45:06] create so many jobs in America that

[45:08] we're going to look at this

[45:09] anti-immigration kind of moment in time

[45:12] and think we're idiots now nobody wants

[45:14] violent immigrants in the country we

[45:16] need another 150 million people in this

[45:18] country in order to man The factories to

[45:22] staff these factories to make these

[45:24] weapons to make iPhones to make cars to

[45:26] make rockets here in America we need to

[45:28] be on uh an America 500 program 500

[45:32] million citizens now we want to do that

[45:35] correctly I don't know how you feel

[45:36] about immigration but I do think you're

[45:38] going to have a hard time finding

[45:39] Factory workers no yeah it's going to be

[45:41] tough but I think it's a very exciting

[45:42] product and a lot of people want to come

[45:44] work on autonomous robot guns so we

[45:47] people in a factory building stuff like

[45:49] this make per hour like I I know when

[45:51] they work in like a car factory they

[45:53] make 30 bucks an hour something like

[45:55] that I don't know I think yearly

[45:55] salaries are somewhere between like 90

[45:57] and 125 yeah wow that's a great job

[46:01] that's a great job that's a great job

[46:04] that's own a home job yeah it is a

[46:07] really good job have one parent stay

[46:10] home job and raise kids job like that is

[46:12] back to classic

[46:14] American one parent gets to stay home

[46:16] another makes enough money to pay A2 or

[46:19] $3,000 a month morgage we're going to re

[46:21] let's we're going to reindustrialize and

[46:23] the VCS are helping make that happen all

[46:25] right let's go I want I want to squeeze

[46:27] in one more question before we we have

[46:29] go we can keep you on all day but um how

[46:32] soon are you going to put together a

[46:34] GoFundMe that I can take some of my

[46:36] money to put into that way we can send

[46:39] that you bring it up is uh I get like

[46:41] all these emails all the time because I

[46:43] went on Fox Business the other like a

[46:45] couple months ago for this and uh

[46:46] everyone always emails like what's the

[46:47] ticker symbol when can we get in how do

[46:49] we do it what yeah yeah I don't want he

[46:53] wants to fund it to to send some to

[46:55] Ukraine to stop Putin in

[47:10] donated a Bitcoin so that the ukrainians

[47:13] could buy

[47:14] javelins so like my you're totally

[47:16] aligned with my CTO I'll have to connect

[47:18] you guys awesome

[47:20] do you're putting you're hiring four

[47:24] Engineers uh where can they go your

[47:27] email because there's a lot of Engineers

[47:29] listening to this working on nonsense at

[47:32] uh Facebook trying to get people to you

[47:35] know increase the clickthrough rate on

[47:37] some scam ad by

[47:41] 0.01% when they could be actually doing

[47:43] something important with their lives

[47:44] like working at your compan they gotta

[47:45] get them email Steve thanks thanks again

[47:47] email Steve allencc control systems.com

[50:17] it's a little bit of that but interviews

[50:19] Jason let's have our next guest on

[50:21] because this is uh this is one that's

[50:23] actually very exciting from the launch

[50:24] perspective we're going to talk to Ramy

[50:26] Abu Habib the CEO and co-founder of a

[50:28] company called quario hey there he is

[50:31] hey Ramy how are you sir I'm good thank

[50:34] you for pronouncing my name right um

[50:37] very excited to talk about the second

[50:39] half of American dynamism B2B SAS it's

[50:42] very exciting no pressure Ramy what are

[50:45] you doing in the world what did you get

[50:47] done this week are you protecting

[50:48] democracy and Humanity in my own way in

[50:51] my own way I am producing jobs and I am

[50:53] protecting democracy absolutely uh well

[50:56] welcome to the program tell us a little

[50:57] bit about what you're working on and uh

[50:59] maybe even show us a little bit about

[51:01] what you're working on yeah yeah sure so

[51:03] great to talk I'm Robie we're building

[51:04] quero quero is the you know best way for

[51:07] teams to work with data um we really try

[51:09] to make sure that everyone can work with

[51:10] data at a way that manages their

[51:12] technical level I think over the last

[51:14] couple decades we've you know generally

[51:16] perceived data as a very transactional

[51:18] relationship you have someone else bring

[51:20] you what you need most people can't ACC

[51:22] it themselves the literacy is quite low

[51:24] and year by year data just becomes more

[51:26] important right one of the only jobs

[51:27] that are still you know higher in demand

[51:29] than Supply are data jobs data scientist

[51:31] data analyst Etc so how do you make that

[51:34] new generation tool where those

[51:35] technical people feel like their needs

[51:37] are met and the business people feel

[51:38] like their needs are met without

[51:39] compromise um I think is the biggest

[51:41] thing so can you show us like uh maybe

[51:44] take the screen over here and show us

[51:46] the product uh full disclosure you uh

[51:50] went to our accelerator I'm unsure if

[51:52] you went to founder University before

[51:53] that I did I did you made me quit my job

[51:56] and then after that I built a company

[51:58] and then got into the accelerator and

[52:00] now we're here okay so maybe before we

[52:02] even go into your product let's explain

[52:05] that Journey for a second

[52:07] because you know uh for people who don't

[52:10] know uh I found myself as an early stage

[52:13] investor when seoa Capital asked me to

[52:15] be their first Scout along with a

[52:17] gentleman named Sam mman he did stri I

[52:19] did

[52:20] Uber and uh that got me started as an

[52:22] investor and one of the things I found

[52:24] over the years Alex was I I got up to

[52:26] four or 5,000 applications for funding a

[52:29] year all in broke out become became a

[52:31] public phenomenon crossed over into you

[52:34] know public M share and I went from

[52:35] 5,000 applications a year to 20,000

[52:37] coming into our database but the problem

[52:40] was a lot of companies Alex was a lot to

[52:43] go through so now I have seven full-time

[52:45] researchers and analysts going through

[52:47] those putting them in a database well

[52:49] they're already in a database but you

[52:50] know sorting through them and meeting

[52:52] with the top four or 5,000 of the top

[52:55] 20,000 but what we found when we looked

[52:58] at the data Alex was half the companies

[53:00] were incredible teams that hadn't

[53:02] Incorporated yet but they had a killer

[53:05] idea and they had two or three

[53:07] co-founders who were technical product

[53:09] managers just awesome we had no way to

[53:12] engage them we'd say oh like let us know

[53:15] when you raise money I guess and then I

[53:16] was like you know what I'm going to come

[53:18] up with a solution I came up with

[53:19] founder University a 12we course people

[53:21] come to it they don't need to be

[53:22] incorporated we invite 250 teams and

[53:24] then we'll just invest in whichever 10%

[53:27] to 20% 25 to 50 companies will'll give

[53:30] them 25k or 125k as their first

[53:34] investor because I would like to be the

[53:36] first investor in another unicorn so

[53:39] that people can stop saying I was the

[53:40] third or fourth investor in Uber and I

[53:42] can just have and I think you're compan

[53:44] that anyway long story short this has

[53:47] helped us engage with another thousand

[53:49] companies a year and invest in another

[53:51] hundred companies a year because we have

[53:54] a pre accelerator that's the the setting

[53:57] here so how did you find out about

[53:58] founder University yeah so funny enough

[54:00] I found about it on X um through U

[54:03] actually I was following and I and I saw

[54:05] about found University and so I applied

[54:07] um at the time I was working at Amazon I

[54:08] had a great idea I was kind of like the

[54:10] personification of CUO as a as a person

[54:12] and I worked in a lot of Technical and

[54:14] business roles and uh me and my

[54:16] co-founder who I met at UT Austin

[54:18] actually I lived in Austin for for a few

[54:20] years and I think Salt Lake and Wimberly

[54:21] is better than Terry blacks but I'll

[54:23] leave that for other people to to judge

[54:26] salt frequency it's about 10 minutes

[54:27] from here yeah nice yeah yeah um and

[54:31] yeah played for University and got in

[54:33] and uh ended up you know we had built an

[54:35] MVP it worked really well uh got a lot

[54:37] of good value out of the um um you know

[54:40] program and then we ended up getting

[54:42] investment from the pre- accelerator and

[54:43] that was really kind of like that big

[54:45] push that made us incorporate uh we both

[54:47] committed to quero fulltime quit our

[54:49] jobs um my my co-founder he had um

[54:52] worked an operator at a couple of exited

[54:54] startups and it really just lined

[54:56] everything up for us and really gave us

[54:57] that initial push that we needed to keep

[54:59] going so just to be clear my thesis was

[55:01] hey if I build this thing founder

[55:03] University I might get people to quit

[55:04] their jobs at Amazon or Uber or wherever

[55:07] they are and start their company and

[55:09] that first 25 or 125k check could be the

[55:13] thing that just you know helps them make

[55:16] the jump and in this case that was in

[55:18] fact what happened yes yes the plan

[55:21] worked surprisingly yes literally warms

[55:24] my heart that we made a plan we EX on it

[55:26] and it happened which is very rare that

[55:28] is really rare for a plan to work out

[55:29] but yes I love it when a plan comes

[55:31] together if you a child of the 80s you

[55:34] remember the 18 I love it when a plan

[55:36] comes together I got to I got to get my

[55:37] cigar out so um show us the product here

[55:40] enough with the uh we we we've done the

[55:43] self-

[55:44] congratulatory uh Victory lap here an

[55:47] idea worked but let's see what your idea

[55:49] is let's make this about absolutely I

[55:51] will show you the current version of CUO

[55:52] and maybe we can talk about how it's

[55:54] going to be changing um but yeah so

[55:56] first and foremost CUO is a bi tool

[55:58] business intelligence um platform it's

[56:01] to help businesses analyze their data

[56:02] and query their data um so today we're

[56:05] going to be looking at some data for

[56:06] Dunder Mifflin um for those not familiar

[56:08] that is a very famous TV show um called

[56:11] the office so I can ask C you know who

[56:13] am

[56:14] I and it should tell me who I am of

[56:18] course I'm going to be the best

[56:19] character um on the show which is

[56:21] obviously Michael Scott um he is

[56:24] hilarious so yes we are Michael Scott

[56:25] Regional man of scraton PA that's

[56:27] fantastic um pretty much like other

[56:31] classical bi tools uh you have things

[56:33] like you know Dash boards where you can

[56:35] track things that you're creating that

[56:36] refresh automatically that you can fil

[56:38] classic Bol what would the top two or

[56:40] three people would recognize as business

[56:42] intelligence Tool uh looker Tableau um

[56:46] maybe sap if you're in a very old

[56:48] organization um those are kind of like

[56:50] the more larger ones and you have some

[56:52] new age ones like thought spot

[56:53] potentially depending on how modern your

[56:55] organization is but I think think

[56:56] Tableau and looker would make most

[56:57] people's buiness intelligence started in

[57:00] 2000 or so 2000 to 2010 those companies

[57:03] started

[57:04] to sap yeah so like sap really started

[57:07] the whole you know online chart creation

[57:09] where data team was making these charts

[57:11] that they could send through their

[57:12] business counterparts for them to track

[57:13] things that was really like the first

[57:15] big one second big wave came with

[57:16] Tableau they let you actually filter

[57:18] them looker let you look at the tables

[57:20] underneath them you know every five

[57:21] years you got a bit more control on the

[57:23] business side um and this is where an

[57:26] entire

[57:28] career um emerged for people who would

[57:32] be in big data what what are the job

[57:34] titles that were created because of this

[57:36] over the last two decades it started off

[57:39] with like business analysts who would

[57:40] just analyze business data data analyst

[57:42] would be a little more technical you

[57:45] have the the engineers who would

[57:47] actually move all the data around the

[57:48] data engineers and then you have the

[57:50] data scientists who forecast do deeper

[57:52] analysis that became more of machine

[57:53] learning when that came out um and then

[57:56] some ad hoc ones you have like developer

[57:58] analytics and and some random kind of

[58:00] more Niche ones but uh yeah okay so

[58:03] that's great so this entire industry has

[58:06] boomed over the last 20 years Alex to

[58:08] give context that 10 years before that

[58:09] we saw things like databases and storage

[58:12] and the internet kind of get was the

[58:15] setup to all of this right Romy like the

[58:18] fact that people had cheap storage the

[58:19] internet there was a lot more data

[58:21] recorded and then people said well what

[58:23] what's in this data and a classic

[58:25] example that would be somebody like

[58:27] Amazon who has sales

[58:29] data they have website data too much

[58:33] 1998 till today there are so many

[58:36] databases at Amazon it is crazy yeah

[58:39] yeah you know you can't fit things in an

[58:40] Excel right you have over a million rows

[58:42] you're getting hundreds of millions of

[58:44] new rols like every hour every day part

[58:47] of the setup is all this data exists you

[58:50] have to go to somebody like a developer

[58:53] get them off of building a product ask

[58:55] them questions wait a week or two then

[58:58] you forgot that you put the request in

[58:59] and then they come back to say hey I did

[59:01] about 5 days of work here's your data

[59:04] yeah only for them to not actually be in

[59:06] your day-to-day not understand the

[59:07] Nuance of your question and you have to

[59:09] tell them okay that's that didn't pass

[59:11] sniff check I think you looked at this

[59:12] wrong can you pull it this way instead

[59:14] okay so that's our setup for your the

[59:15] average ticket success time at Amazon

[59:17] fun fact was about five weeks for a

[59:19] general dat yeah that's like two years

[59:23] five

[59:23] weeks insane amount of time

[59:26] it's ridiculous Ry if I understand that

[59:28] the the point of querio is that it

[59:30] brings in a lot of traditional bi toing

[59:33] charts dashboards and so forth but it

[59:35] also lets me query it in plain English

[59:37] so that way I don't have to go to a data

[59:40] analyst or data scientist I myself the

[59:42] person in a business role can do it

[59:44] myself yeah so that's one part of it I

[59:46] think you know I think it's really great

[59:48] that Compass are trying to be more data

[59:49] literate I think it's great that we're

[59:51] now buying data products for companies

[59:53] but you know you you look at Tableau I

[59:54] think something like 9 5% of the lies

[59:57] they sell are just for viewers you can't

[59:58] even make anything you can't even drag

[60:00] and drop columns to make charts wow um

[60:02] and so it's great that we have all these

[60:04] tools we agree everyone should have

[60:05] access to them but most people can't

[60:07] actually use them they can just kind of

[60:08] open them and look at something um and

[60:10] so you know we're trying to build that

[60:12] bi tool we are building it where how do

[60:14] you make the data people's lives better

[60:16] you know not only are you going to save

[60:17] them time how do you make their

[60:17] workflows actually better because you

[60:19] want to convince them with more than

[60:20] just you'll have a few less questions

[60:22] then how do we make those business

[60:23] people kind of flip that on the head and

[60:24] instead of having only a trans action

[60:26] relationship waiting that you get to do

[60:28] some more work yourself um and uh yeah

[60:31] so I mean we can jump into a couple of

[60:33] question see how querio would answer

[60:34] them but okay yeah so we we have this we

[60:37] have some data here in quero it's

[60:39] quo. just so people want to go look at

[60:41] the website and uh this is year one of

[60:44] your company basically yes and you've

[60:46] built your what was an MVP when we met

[60:49] now it's a it's an actual product that

[60:51] people can buy yes and customers hands

[60:53] and and people have Bots yes yes wow

[60:55] amazing that's great to see that all

[60:56] happen within yeah under 18 months so

[60:59] what can people do with it because this

[61:01] is so you don't have to wait 5 weeks

[61:03] right is that was when you originally

[61:06] talked to me about it was like hey

[61:07] there's no reason

[61:09] for you know 100% of people in an

[61:12] organization should be able to make

[61:13] these queries of the data sets and and

[61:15] we want to make a tool that takes out

[61:18] that telephone game yeah yeah we want to

[61:20] take a tool that takes out the Alo game

[61:22] that's exactly it and also a tool that

[61:23] will serve what the current needs are

[61:26] but even better so let's start with the

[61:27] one we're generally talking about which

[61:29] is you don't need to have this telephone

[61:30] game going back and forth in someone

[61:32] Technical and getting the context in the

[61:33] business team so yeah we have some data

[61:35] we have some account data orders data

[61:37] the dunder Thunder Mifflin sells paper

[61:40] products to a bunch of different

[61:41] companies so uh we can ask a question

[61:44] like you know let's list the top 10

[61:46] products by revenue and give us their

[61:47] quantity sold um pretty basic question

[61:51] so we can ask it quero can look through

[61:53] the database understand how it all joins

[61:55] understand how it works it'll tell you

[61:56] what it's going to do in English write

[61:58] the code for you right after this just a

[62:00] SQL query and you can see it if you're

[62:02] technical you know just to uh you can be

[62:04] sure that it's right um and then just

[62:06] like that you get your answer really

[62:08] quick uh you have some Classics up

[62:10] rather you can sort the data whatever it

[62:11] is which is really nice um but you can

[62:14] do more than that right this is a

[62:15] querying question like just asking show

[62:17] me the x of these it's kind of like

[62:18] clicking through some Excel sheets but

[62:19] through a database that you can't see

[62:21] what if we had a question like you know

[62:23] are there any salespeople that have to

[62:24] offer some discounts to close a deal you

[62:26] know which account managers are offering

[62:28] the most discounts yeah i' like to know

[62:30] that myself yeah so that's my bet is

[62:32] Michael Scott probably he seems like the

[62:34] kind of guy who would uh offer a lot of

[62:36] discounts so yeah it's going to join the

[62:38] orders in account table for instance on

[62:40] account ID so it has an idea of how all

[62:42] the tables relate which is a really

[62:43] complex thing that a lot of data teams

[62:45] struggle with sometimes and then it's

[62:47] going to C calculate the average

[62:48] discount percentage so just like that we

[62:51] have a list of all of our account

[62:52] managers the average discount percentage

[62:54] it looks like Aon hanon is actually

[62:55] number one and Michael Scott is third so

[62:58] or actually he's like my guy Ryan at the

[63:00] bottom because Ryan just holds the

[63:02] Liney we don't discount that's it no

[63:05] discounts we we charge a fair price he

[63:07] holds the line yeah yeah um and yeah and

[63:10] I guess what's really cool with these

[63:11] kind of products like you could think of

[63:13] AI as the best data scientist that ever

[63:15] existed but it's the first day at your

[63:17] company and so the biggest thing we have

[63:18] to solve is how do you get this digital

[63:21] kind of context understanding of how

[63:22] your company and your data works so that

[63:24] it can write the correct queries right

[63:25] it's not looking at the rows of data

[63:27] it's actually just writing the code

[63:28] instructions to pull data from a

[63:30] database um and we do that through

[63:31] something called our knowledge base and

[63:33] it's basically where and here it is it's

[63:35] where we kind of capture all the details

[63:36] of every column how all the tables join

[63:39] um usually column names aren't very

[63:40] descriptive of what's actually in them

[63:43] um and I think maybe about like 15% of

[63:45] my time at Amazon when I was working

[63:46] with data was just trying to find it um

[63:49] and so this is great in that end so Romy

[63:51] on that point though how hard is it to

[63:53] onboard a new customer into this uh into

[63:56] do they have to change how they upload

[63:59] data into the service or can it parse a

[64:02] variety of different uh I don't know

[64:03] inbound sources from different companies

[64:05] that might have different approaches to

[64:07] storing their

[64:08] information um so to start off how hard

[64:12] it is it's funny it's actually the the

[64:13] more mature the company is the easier it

[64:15] is so if they don't have a data team

[64:17] they're maybe only running with a CTO

[64:18] maybe some Engineers like flexing doing

[64:20] two roles and they don't really have the

[64:22] time to set it up that's where we can

[64:23] you know have a bit more of a manual

[64:25] approach you know unscalable things when

[64:27] you're starting off um but data teams

[64:29] are quite used to building things called

[64:30] Data models and data cataloges where

[64:32] they actually kind of document what's in

[64:33] the data to make sure that it works and

[64:35] we have our own system how we Define

[64:37] things so that they maximize efficiency

[64:38] for the data teams and also automated

[64:41] like um AI process um there's nothing

[64:44] they need to change um at all so it's

[64:46] something they just um you know like

[64:49] fill out in um in their own way you can

[64:51] also already have kind of schemas of how

[64:53] the data works and how they already join

[64:55] that pre-exist

[64:56] um we have an agent system that can also

[64:58] fill out to do a first pass where they

[64:59] can check um and we can go into more

[65:02] details but yeah it's inversely

[65:04] correlated with the maturity of the of

[65:05] the company no I appreciate that and

[65:07] then does that actually help your uh

[65:09] early customer acquisition are you

[65:10] dealing mostly with larger more Legacy

[65:12] clients that are therefore easier to

[65:13] onboard or are you selling more to

[65:15] startups today that have more of an

[65:16] issue getting set up that's a great

[65:18] question yeah so you know the whole

[65:20] thing we're trying to build here which

[65:21] is meeting everyone at their technical

[65:22] level you can see everything I demoed

[65:24] today is really really good for those

[65:25] people that aren't Technical and need to

[65:27] ask open-ended and so that process is

[65:30] working really well but it's a it's a

[65:31] it's a you know cash 22 since we are

[65:34] built for those non-technical people

[65:35] they're also the hardest to onboard um

[65:37] and so the next phase of the company

[65:39] over the next six months is we're

[65:40] building out a lot more of the features

[65:42] that those data teams are going to love

[65:44] um and then that'll you know increase

[65:46] our acvs and then also lower our

[65:48] onboarding times and our sales Cycles

[65:49] which will be great is the way to go to

[65:52] market here I always like to think about

[65:54] go to market strategies in year one of a

[65:57] company you know as you get into year

[65:59] two you got to really be thoughtful

[66:02] about who is your ideal customer profile

[66:04] and I wonder if you've given thought to

[66:07] hey I use tools like looker I use

[66:10] Tableau and so I'm going to add this to

[66:12] my utility belt and put it into the mix

[66:16] or do you think hey our ideal customer

[66:19] is somebody who Tableau and looker are

[66:21] too complicated for and they don't have

[66:24] it yet but they do have underlying data

[66:26] in other words they're kind of a tweener

[66:29] they're not like data blind where they

[66:31] don't care about data they're just

[66:33] running some small business they're not

[66:36] data driven organizations but they're

[66:39] like that sort of middle mid size

[66:42] company how do you think about which one

[66:43] to go after that's a great question um

[66:47] well I think I'll start off by saying

[66:48] that any company that needs the internet

[66:49] to run is probably going to need to

[66:51] analyze data okay you know outside of

[66:53] like maybe like some Niche e-commerce

[66:55] stores for the most part it it's it's a

[66:57] fundamental part of most businesses and

[66:58] and they can't avoid it at some point um

[67:02] I think we've had customers already

[67:04] leave products like looker and metabase

[67:06] and Cabana for us which mainly means

[67:09] that we are taking the market share we

[67:11] don't think we're directly competitive

[67:13] um but the idea is not to be part of the

[67:15] belt it's to give them a solution that

[67:17] actually fits their needs a lot better

[67:19] um which those tools just don't so it's

[67:21] more of the second one which is to

[67:22] replace those tools and give them

[67:24] functionality and actually consult the

[67:26] two or three tools um instead of just

[67:28] replace one see I think this is like a

[67:30] very interesting exercise Alex it's one

[67:33] I like to do with Founders is just have

[67:35] this dialogue so what you're seeing here

[67:37] when I when I ask uh Romy a question

[67:39] like this is I I have my own thoughts on

[67:41] it I like to hear the founders thoughts

[67:45] on it and then I can ask another probing

[67:48] question and this is what eventually

[67:51] results in a board of directors creating

[67:54] a plan and then that plan is for the

[67:57] next year and you execute against it and

[67:59] then you put priorities and resources

[68:03] against a plan and as Doug Leone told me

[68:06] hope is not a plan plan is a plan make a

[68:08] plan and so now when I look at these

[68:11] things I have a really um interesting

[68:15] humble approach I just listen to

[68:17] Founders and when I hear you talk Ry it

[68:20] was just like a bunch of things burned

[68:22] in my head I realize there's some

[68:24] brilliance to the Simplicity of your

[68:26] product that even people who could

[68:29] figure out a complex Legacy product and

[68:32] a legacy product tends to be any product

[68:34] over 10 20 years any product that's over

[68:37] 10 years is now a legacy product because

[68:39] interfaces change AI changes there's so

[68:41] many different way to do it and it

[68:43] reminded me of a discussion I was having

[68:47] with a friend of mine when you get to a

[68:48] certain scale house Alex and you've

[68:51] experienced this I think with your

[68:52] in-laws and some other folks uh you

[68:54] mentioned

[68:56] um you uh will be told you have to

[68:59] install a home automation system like

[69:01] questron or Sant these things cost

[69:05] hundreds of thousands of dollars to

[69:07] implement but on a $10 million home

[69:08] you're like well it's one or two% of the

[69:10] cost of the home I need something to

[69:11] manage this home nobody ever uses them

[69:13] they're always broken they require

[69:15] somebody for $200 or $300 an hour to

[69:16] come in and reprogram everything and you

[69:18] get to have this moment where you have a

[69:22] weird remote control people come stay at

[69:24] your house they can't turn on the news

[69:25] or watch the Nick game or put on

[69:27] music every time I buy a new home I rip

[69:30] this right out Alex and you know

[69:32] what I do Sonos and Apple tv yeah we're

[69:36] done you hear that rumor that Apple's

[69:37] releasing a like a control center for

[69:39] homes I I predicted this two years ago

[69:42] we did something what should Apple do

[69:44] next if they're not going to do project

[69:45] tit in the car I said the number one

[69:47] thing they should do is home automation

[69:49] cuz I use apple home it's garbage I use

[69:51] Google home it's okay um I love Google

[69:54] drop cams which became Nest they screwed

[69:57] that whole thing up um but I just go

[70:00] with Sonos because it's elegantly simple

[70:03] and it's beautiful and I go with Apple

[70:05] TV because again everybody knows how to

[70:08] use it and so I think there's something

[70:11] to Simplicity and ux and design that you

[70:13] may have hit on that would even make the

[70:16] person who wants to put in the $250,000

[70:19] savan system uh or control 4 Falls in

[70:22] this bucket where you're not allowed to

[70:24] make changes to it you need a technical

[70:26] person blah blah blah ah screw it like

[70:29] go with that go with elegantly simple

[70:31] there's something to it me you're

[70:33] looking at one of our first customers

[70:34] they were paying 60k a year for Looker

[70:37] and only the CTO was technical enough to

[70:39] use it o from a SE of 20 and it and and

[70:42] it's ridiculous and not not just that

[70:44] they paid for a separate tool they were

[70:45] also paying for hex because looker

[70:47] doesn't support python so we haven't

[70:48] actually gotten into the non AI part

[70:50] that we're improving there are some bi

[70:52] tools like M analytics they got bought

[70:54] by thoughts spot but the Legacy tools

[70:56] don't even support python natively which

[70:57] is which is not an AI thing they just

[70:59] only do SQL and data teams are not

[71:01] having to buy a python tool like a

[71:02] jupyter notebook uh like post and a SQL

[71:05] tool that has let some host dashboards

[71:07] like on looker and then it's ridiculous

[71:09] and they're paying six figures attime

[71:12] seed definitely at series a for like

[71:15] three people to have some good data how

[71:17] much cheaper can you go compared to

[71:19] those kind of Legacy price points I'm

[71:20] curious how much of um a price War we

[71:22] might see as you guys take on these

[71:24] incumbents

[71:25] I think the tools are are decently

[71:27] complex to make where there's not going

[71:29] to be like a flood of these really kind

[71:31] of consolidating python with like good

[71:33] AI agents with good SQL IDs um so right

[71:36] now our average ACV is about uh 8K 8 to

[71:40] 10K um our two newest customers were at

[71:43] the 15K ideally next year we can start

[71:45] reliably closing those 20 25ks um I 50%

[71:50] off as a baseline I think is the pricing

[71:54] with yeah and and it's great because if

[71:55] we can get up to their current acvs but

[71:58] offer you know we you can also get rid

[72:00] of this other tool that has nothing to

[72:01] do with looker now you're great value

[72:04] prop and we're going to get more value

[72:05] out of your business team they're going

[72:06] to be able to selfs serve more you know

[72:08] you data team or CTO you're going to

[72:10] have a lot more time on your hands and

[72:11] the other python Works going to be

[72:12] quicker um there's just a lot of value

[72:14] to claim from so many different ends

[72:15] which is really nice all right Romy uh

[72:17] this has been great I want to let people

[72:19] know three things if you like Ramy are

[72:22] working at a company and you have a

[72:24] great idea waiting for you founder.

[72:26] University number two if you have a MVP

[72:31] you got a couple of beta customers I'm

[72:33] waiting for you launch accelerator

[72:34] launch. apply number three once in a

[72:38] while if I have a great company um we

[72:40] will share that company with other Angel

[72:43] Investors and help them get in early and

[72:46] that's done through something called The

[72:48] Syndicate I was able to get the IP

[72:50] Around The Syndicate after I left

[72:51] angelist so I have the syndicate.com

[72:53] 11,000 angel investors I think 4,000

[72:56] have actually done a deal with us we've

[72:57] done 300 of these deals so go to the

[72:59] syndicate.com and you might see

[73:01] companies uh that come out of our

[73:03] programs who are raising small amounts

[73:05] of money at reasonable valuations to

[73:08] kind of get to the next step if you're a

[73:10] high-risk accredited investor you can

[73:12] join The Syndicate uh there's a waiting

[73:14] period like 30 days and then you have to

[73:17] be accredited right now maybe in the

[73:18] future that changes to syndicate.com go

[73:20] apply now and you in worst case scenario

[73:22] Alex you read the deal memos and you say

[73:24] no to everything but you get smarter
