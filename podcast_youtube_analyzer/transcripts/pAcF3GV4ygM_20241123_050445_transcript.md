[0:00] people are like look we're going to

[0:01] really crack the code and come up with

[0:02] that like super AGI I don't see that

[0:04] happening because the next model is more

[0:06] expensive and requires even more people

[0:07] have to be even more careful about it I

[0:09] would believe that if you would say hey

[0:11] gbt 5 will cost $1 and it's going to

[0:14] take 1 seconds to create we're not

[0:16] headed in that direction it's the

[0:17] opposite welcome to the Logan Bartlet

[0:18] show on this episode what you're going

[0:19] to hear is a conversation I have with

[0:21] Ali Gody Ali is the co-founder and CEO

[0:24] of datab bricks a business valued at

[0:25] over $50 billion datab brick sits in the

[0:28] center of the artificial intelligence

[0:30] Revolution that we're seeing today Alie

[0:31] and I talk about the state of AI as well

[0:33] as what he's seeing going on at the

[0:35] ground level his view on the Federation

[0:37] of models that he sees coming as well as

[0:40] what he sees for the future of AI over

[0:41] the course of the next couple years we

[0:43] also go into the founding of data bricks

[0:45] his journey to becoming ultimately the

[0:46] CEO as well as the different operating

[0:48] principles that he runs the company with

[0:50] today a really fun conversation that

[0:52] you're here with Ali

[0:57] now OE thanks for doing this of course

[1:00] my so so you've been doing artificial

[1:02] intelligence since 2013 with data bricks

[1:06] with data bricks yeah before that we

[1:08] were at Berkeley we were doing also AI

[1:10] when did you actually start I think 2009

[1:12] we started participating early

[1:14] 20091 um spark when it was originally

[1:17] created was to participate in the

[1:18] Netflix competition which was hey they

[1:20] gave you all these movies and you had to

[1:21] do recommendations and they would you

[1:23] know think give it million dollars a

[1:24] half a million dollars to the winner so

[1:26] we got the highest score on that

[1:28] together with another team so you're 15

[1:30] years in now yeah it obviously it was

[1:32] considered somewhat Niche and maybe

[1:34] academic initially and then obviously

[1:36] we're in a very different point today

[1:38] I'm curious uh as you as chat gbt

[1:42] happened and uh that moment where it

[1:45] seemingly went from Enterprise and

[1:47] business use to sort of mainstream

[1:49] consumer adoption did that change your

[1:51] perspective on artificial intelligence

[1:52] in any way not really I think that uh it

[1:56] kind of changed I think from 2013 145 I

[2:00] just didn't understand why people don't

[2:01] really get into AI uh you know in 2014 I

[2:05] remember having this debate with many of

[2:07] the people at the company that I wanted

[2:08] to call it AI they said no that's like

[2:10] not authentic which you call it machine

[2:11] learning it's ML and I said look once

[2:14] this stuff goes mainstream you know

[2:16] mainstream it's not going to be called

[2:18] ml right they're like no but that's not

[2:19] accurate AI is Robotics and uh I just

[2:22] never could understand why it's not much

[2:23] bigger of a deal it was kind of a little

[2:25] bit esoteric uh machine learning AI uh

[2:29] and in you know 2022 November there it

[2:31] just made all the sense but then the

[2:34] magnitude of how much it sort of just

[2:37] shook everybody up that was kind of a

[2:39] shock it was surprising to you was there

[2:41] points that you looked back on actually

[2:42] in those 15 years that were actually

[2:45] maybe groundbreaking to you that you're

[2:48] but but not to the mainstream yeah I

[2:50] mean like when we started people weren't

[2:52] really using machine learning for other

[2:54] things than attech it was really ad

[2:56] placement you know clicked through you

[2:59] know clicked click streams for logs to

[3:01] place ads and so on so I would say 20145

[3:05] when we said really large Enterprises

[3:08] started using this stuff for more

[3:09] interesting things like Expedia how they

[3:11] listed the hotels that how you ranked

[3:14] the listing of the hotels gave them a

[3:16] huge Revenue uplift it was kind of a

[3:17] game changer uh regeneron found a sort

[3:21] of um so they found the marker in the

[3:24] genetic DNA for a disease and they were

[3:26] developing drugs so you could start

[3:27] seeing like wow this has really big

[3:28] impact on a lot of these companies that

[3:30] was a big deal uh but then I would say

[3:33] 201819 we started seeing the natural

[3:35] language processing breakthroughs coming

[3:37] you know with gpt2 and so on it was

[3:39] already pretty pretty amazing so it was

[3:42] pretty clear that the touring test would

[3:44] be broken soon in a couple years or so

[3:46] so uh so you know there been many of

[3:48] them but yeah who would have anticipated

[3:49] that the whole world would like kind of

[3:50] wake up in this way and this would be

[3:51] like front news every day uh you know

[3:55] yeah hard to believe I I've heard you

[3:56] compare the chat GPD moment to the

[3:58] iPhone moment can you you compare that

[4:00] analogy and what the implications are

[4:02] for apps and maybe how Enterprises or

[4:05] users should think about artificial

[4:06] intelligence yeah I mean when the iPhone

[4:07] came out everybody realized kind of what

[4:09] the smartphone Revolution would be and

[4:11] what happened immediately was that every

[4:13] company on the planet said we have to

[4:14] build lots of apps we have to build our

[4:16] own iPhone apps um and so there was this

[4:19] play activity all the companies building

[4:22] apps but you know did the apps really

[4:23] make sense a lot of the apps that they

[4:25] built you know I I kind of joke about it

[4:27] and I say it's kind of like building

[4:28] flashlight application for your iPhone

[4:30] uh but then a couple years later the

[4:31] iPhone just has the flashlight built in

[4:33] and I think 2023 was one of those years

[4:35] that everybody wanted to say hey I own

[4:37] AI at our company I am the AI leader I

[4:39] am the geni so there were a lot of chat

[4:40] Bots that were built and you know

[4:43] they'll be just like there's an app for

[4:45] that in 2007 or8 there's going to be an

[4:47] AI company for that that just does that

[4:49] um so um you know for instance people

[4:52] building chat bot for HR documentation

[4:55] you can ask you know what's your policy

[4:57] on paternity leave or maternity leave um

[4:59] and companies building that but doesn't

[5:01] make sense that a company builds that

[5:02] for themselves it makes more sense that

[5:03] there is a SAS app for that and

[5:05] everybody just buys that and a little

[5:07] bit we're in this moment where there's a

[5:09] lot of like Hey we're going to build our

[5:11] own flashlight app or whatever chat app

[5:13] for everything and now we're seeing

[5:16] slowly the companies being built and the

[5:19] apps being built that are going to

[5:20] specialize and we're all going to just

[5:22] leverage them I think we're like in the

[5:24] first Innings of that so so to take that

[5:26] analogy a step further do you think that

[5:28] they ultimate will be disintermediation

[5:32] between the End customer and maybe the

[5:33] HRS system where a native AI business

[5:36] sort of takes in that natural language

[5:38] interface and no longer would work day

[5:40] or ADP or whoever it is on the back end

[5:42] sort of serve as the interface to the

[5:44] user could be I think that this Dynamic

[5:47] is playing out that in this AI era uh

[5:50] data is extremely important like so why

[5:52] shouldn't everybody build their own chat

[5:54] app well you know you should really ask

[5:56] yourself what's your competitive

[5:57] Advantage as a company what is it you

[5:58] can do uniquely that no one else in your

[6:00] industry can do everybody can call open

[6:02] AI llm so you're just calling you know

[6:05] GPT 4 or five or six that's not going to

[6:07] help um so what does you have typically

[6:08] it comes back to the data or some

[6:10] customer relationship but typically data

[6:12] you must have some data advantage that

[6:13] nobody else has um so that's what it's

[6:16] going to come down to um the big

[6:19] companies the incumbents they have that

[6:21] data Advantage right they have customers

[6:23] and they're collecting a lot of data uh

[6:25] so the question is can they leverage

[6:26] that data advantage and incorporate the

[6:29] AI and do the Innovation that's needed

[6:31] on the other hand we've seen in these

[6:33] waves before that you'll have these

[6:35] smart founding teams that are just

[6:36] completely disrupted thinking about

[6:37] things differently and they'll rise and

[6:39] they'll do things in a way that the big

[6:41] companies are just their sleep at the

[6:42] wheel and they're not going to do I

[6:43] think we're going to see both I think

[6:44] we're going to see some we're going to

[6:45] see a lot of company startups that fail

[6:48] just like in 99 when the internet was

[6:50] about to come uh but we're also going to

[6:52] see a few that become the next Google

[6:54] Facebook and so on but I think we're

[6:56] also going to see some incumbents that

[6:57] actually figure out how to leverage the

[7:00] data that they have and do the

[7:01] Investments needed to crack the code on

[7:03] this we're going to see both of those

[7:05] how exactly that you know fleshes out I

[7:08] I would probably bet more on the

[7:09] startups to be honest than the big ones

[7:11] interesting they move too slow the big

[7:12] ones move too slow and you know if you

[7:14] have like a killer app uh you can get

[7:17] the data fly will probably collecting

[7:19] data on it and grow the usage and then

[7:21] you'll have enough data advantage to be

[7:23] able to do that and if the big guys are

[7:25] not paying attention um they'll move too

[7:27] fast and before you know it it's too

[7:30] late to react where do you think we are

[7:32] in the hype cycle of AI right now I

[7:35] think uh I think that we're going to see

[7:38] there's I don't think like Hey we're in

[7:40] Thro of disillusionment I think it's you

[7:42] know frankly I think it's like somewhere

[7:44] at the top and we're going to see that

[7:47] you know soon we're going to see more

[7:49] and more companies not doing so well and

[7:51] I think there's going to be a narrative

[7:52] that hey this AI thing was complete you

[7:55] know it was over promised there's

[7:57] nothing there the quality of the models

[7:58] aren't there they just don't work this

[8:00] stuff doesn't work it wasn't worth it

[8:02] all these companies and so on so I think

[8:04] we're kind of going in towards that very

[8:06] very soon uh but then I think right

[8:08] after that is you know when we actually

[8:11] going to see those very companies start

[8:14] coming out with these applications that

[8:16] are completely gamechanging for Humanity

[8:18] yeah the good news is crypto's back so

[8:20] uh people bounce back and forth between

[8:22] one and the other I'm curious as we

[8:23] recorded this I guess early November of

[8:26] 24 there's been a bunch of reports about

[8:28] scaling laws and maybe the limitations

[8:30] that we're reaching some of the outer

[8:31] ends and diminishing returns on that do

[8:33] you have any opinion on where we are

[8:35] with scaling laws right now yeah I mean

[8:36] we actually put out a research paper uh

[8:39] you know my co-founder mat zarya uh it's

[8:42] it's about compound AI systems we call

[8:44] it and it was actually put out probably

[8:47] six months ago or maybe even more and it

[8:49] kind of predicts this uh which um what

[8:53] it basically says is that to really eek

[8:55] out that last quality bit now and really

[8:58] like move up the L we really need to

[8:59] build these agent systems where we have

[9:02] many parts many components that work

[9:04] together and in particular it's going to

[9:07] be really important that we can evaluate

[9:09] the quality of that whole AI system on

[9:12] the particular task you want to do like

[9:14] just to take that silly example that I

[9:15] gave HR docs Q&A how well do you answer

[9:19] you know questions from employees on HR

[9:21] documentation not how well do you pass

[9:23] the bar exam or medical exam general

[9:25] intelligence not that but this specific

[9:28] only once we have this evaluation we can

[9:30] start building these agentic systems

[9:32] where we can start doing hill climb so

[9:33] keep improving the quality for that

[9:35] specific task so we call these compound

[9:38] AI systems and these these will also

[9:40] leverage a lot of tools and in they will

[9:43] also leverage classic machine learning

[9:45] because classic machine learning has

[9:47] much better numeracy it's much better

[9:48] dealing with numbers and so on

[9:49] calculators things like nature

[9:51] forecasting and so on um so that's what

[9:54] we call compound thei system and the and

[9:56] the beauty of those uh is that you can

[9:58] when you run them and they get something

[10:00] wrong you can debug which agent got it

[10:03] wrong where was the reasoning step that

[10:05] was broken and you can then improve it

[10:07] you can get better and better and you

[10:08] can do this hill climbing and keep

[10:10] increasing the quality of the model uh

[10:13] or the the AI system scaling laws you

[10:16] pre-bake this gigantic models you wait

[10:19] six months and the model comes out and

[10:21] maybe it's bad at predicting something

[10:23] maybe it's it's numeracy is not good and

[10:25] you can't even know why it's not good

[10:27] there's no way for us to know hey why

[10:28] did it get this thing wrong I don't know

[10:29] you do a bunch of Matrix multiply a

[10:31] bunch of attention layers something

[10:32] plops out it's inaccurate I don't know

[10:35] let's go train a bigger one with more

[10:37] data um so it just seems much easier to

[10:41] do this now more agentic workflows at

[10:44] inference time so it makes a lot of

[10:46] sense I think there's going to be a lot

[10:47] of innovation and it's nothing you know

[10:49] I think everybody's now focused on this

[10:51] do you think there's an implication for

[10:53] like do do you think that results in a

[10:54] Federation of model types and different

[10:57] capabilities that people are uh

[10:59] effectively good for yeah I think you

[11:00] will build AI systems that are very very

[11:03] good at the particular task we see it

[11:04] all the time our customers uh they

[11:07] typically want to do the same thing

[11:08] again and again and again like they have

[11:10] massive data like they have database

[11:12] with SEC filings right and or they're an

[11:14] insurance company and they have all

[11:15] these insurance documents and they want

[11:17] to repetitively again and again on

[11:19] massive amounts of data repetitively do

[11:22] the same task again and again and again

[11:24] so then for them it it comes down to can

[11:27] I what's the highest quality I can do on

[11:28] this specific task I don't need to be

[11:30] good at AGI artificial general

[11:31] intelligence how can I do this again and

[11:33] again really really well and can you

[11:34] give me the lowest cost for that cuz I'm

[11:36] going to do this at scale it's going to

[11:37] cost me a lot of money so then it makes

[11:39] sense to specialize a system that's

[11:41] really really good at that you know

[11:42] having a generic gigantic model just way

[11:44] too costly and actually it won't do as

[11:46] well even though it's really smart it

[11:47] won't do as well at that particular task

[11:49] repetitive task that you want to do so

[11:51] we see this all the time like one of the

[11:53] surprising things on data bricks is you

[11:54] know we have models of all kinds of

[11:55] sizes you can use llama 4005 billion

[11:58] parameters but in aggregate we get more

[12:00] revenue from Tiny models and that was

[12:02] surprising to me because you know per

[12:05] model you make much more on a bigger

[12:06] model uses much more gpus and so on but

[12:11] customers want to take the big models

[12:13] dis still the smallest possible that can

[12:14] get good enough quality and just use

[12:16] that because that saves them money and

[12:18] actually in aggregate we make more money

[12:19] on that so yes I think we're going to

[12:21] see that and you see that in life also

[12:22] like you know are all the tasks that

[12:24] humans are doing all the jobs that are

[12:25] happening our day do you need teren tow

[12:28] for every task you know are you getting

[12:30] the smartest person possible on the

[12:31] planet doing them or many of the jobs

[12:32] are repetitive and some things you know

[12:34] it's good enough and you want to pay

[12:35] this particular price for it so it makes

[12:37] sense that you have a smaller model

[12:38] that's specialized what do you think

[12:39] about the concept of like General

[12:41] reasoning or the path to to maybe not

[12:44] AGI but but um a more holistic

[12:47] understanding and reasoning that sort of

[12:48] underpins these distinct models do you

[12:51] think we're we're approaching a step

[12:52] function in that or do you think that

[12:54] that we've reached some certain plateau

[12:55] in it and now it's about the data and

[12:57] the different functional areas I mean

[12:59] look the scaling laws it's like on a

[13:01] logarithmic uh scale so moving to the

[13:04] right we are going to move to the right

[13:06] and yes that means that we're going to

[13:07] get improved intelligence but you know

[13:10] the next THX is not going to be as you

[13:13] know it's not going to yield as much as

[13:14] the previous THX plus you know um one of

[13:18] our researchers put this out you know

[13:19] over the last 11 years um you know we've

[13:22] had 100 million times Improvement in

[13:24] compute that we've thrown at the problem

[13:26] we're not going to be able to get the

[13:28] same over the next few years we're going

[13:29] to improve it but not as much you know

[13:31] there's just not going to be enough uh

[13:33] energy compute to throw at it and we're

[13:35] not going to have enough data like you

[13:36] know llama was trained on 15 trillion

[13:38] tokens what's that 10x the size of the

[13:41] web are we you know are we going to 100x

[13:43] THX the amount of data that can do that

[13:46] uh getting that high quality data it

[13:47] seems just it gets exceedingly

[13:50] expensive um it's much easier to build

[13:52] these compound thei systems these

[13:54] agentic systems where you can actually

[13:55] debug and get really good at the task so

[13:58] yeah I think there is going to be a

[13:59] Slowdown um I also think that a lot of

[14:02] those things where people are like look

[14:03] we're going to really crack the code and

[14:05] come up with that like super

[14:07] AGI that kind of would require some kind

[14:09] of um you know recursive

[14:11] self-improvement loop I don't see that

[14:13] happening because the next model is more

[14:15] expensive and requires even more people

[14:16] you have to be even more careful about

[14:18] it I would believe that if you would say

[14:20] hey gbt 5 will cost you know $1 and it's

[14:24] going to take one second to create if we

[14:26] were headed in that direction then you

[14:29] could see like okay well then it can

[14:30] spawn off and we can just apply a

[14:32] genetic algorithm do lots of them and

[14:33] pick the best and so on but we're not

[14:35] headed in that direction it's the

[14:36] opposite it's like we're going to do a

[14:37] very specialized data center we're going

[14:38] to build a model over one year period of

[14:40] time we're going to be very careful lots

[14:42] of humans involved uh so um I have I

[14:46] don't have a crystal wall but my guess

[14:48] is that for many more years we need

[14:50] humans in the loop and we need the stuff

[14:53] to be verifiable like we can't just just

[14:56] like we saw with cars or with you know

[14:58] uh

[14:59] you know autopilots in in in airplanes

[15:02] we want to have a human in the loop that

[15:03] can verify that it's not veering off in

[15:07] the wrong direction and it's just

[15:09] accelerating the work that they do today

[15:11] and I think for that we're going to use

[15:12] more of these agentic systems so it

[15:14] sounds like a lot of lead bullets

[15:16] there's no Silver Bullet that you sort

[15:18] of see on the horizon at this point when

[15:19] you hear people talking about like $50

[15:21] billion models or you know throwing all

[15:24] this very good for your business I'm

[15:25] sure as people think about this but um

[15:27] do you think that

[15:29] that all the stuff we were just talking

[15:30] about it means that uh that that's a

[15:33] little pie in the sky and uh and overly

[15:36] ambitious for diminishing returns as

[15:38] people sort of talk about these models

[15:39] at that level of scale well again I

[15:41] don't have a crystal ball and maybe

[15:42] they're right and if they are it's

[15:43] amazing you've been pretty good

[15:44] historically in predicting some of these

[15:45] things yeah well I think that you know

[15:46] the reasoning that they have makes sense

[15:48] which is like Hey we're freaking

[15:49] creating AGI it's worth any cost it

[15:51] doesn't matter what it costs and it

[15:53] doesn't matter what dilution and your

[15:54] economic models done I don't care about

[15:56] them because look at what we're creating

[15:58] makes sense to me if you actually

[15:59] achieve it but um you know I would

[16:02] probably more on the skeptical side um

[16:05] you know spending that much money like

[16:07] my I guess I'm too I guess I'm too much

[16:10] of an operator running a company that

[16:11] needs to think about you know uh you

[16:14] know growth rate LTV CAC you know you

[16:16] know so on and so forth operating margin

[16:18] that I think you know if you got to

[16:19] spend that much money to produce a model

[16:22] and then you have to do inference on

[16:25] that model to you know for it to sort of

[16:27] pay back the Investments that you to

[16:28] train that model and it seems right now

[16:30] the case is that before you've even

[16:32] gotten the money back for how much it

[16:34] cost to train the model it's already

[16:37] commoditized and there's a better

[16:38] version by someone somewhere um so then

[16:41] economically it's just right now not

[16:42] feasible to do that um it seems that for

[16:45] those particular tasks the cost to

[16:47] create these um you know compound

[16:50] agentic systems that were while and the

[16:53] ROI is there why not do that and it can

[16:55] drive a lot of value and continue doing

[16:56] that and then maybe we'll be surprised

[16:58] on one of these you know Labs come up

[17:00] with that super model but I'm skeptical

[17:02] I think that there's going to be a

[17:03] barrier we got to go through some we got

[17:05] to overcome some big barrier to get to

[17:08] that complete autonomous that can you

[17:10] know just get the accuracy right and

[17:12] it's reliable if we

[17:15] froze uh model development right now do

[17:18] you think that the existing capabilities

[17:21] that we have in AI is enough

[17:25] to uh catch up at some point with all

[17:27] the tooling and the applications and all

[17:30] that with the excitement and the promise

[17:31] that we're seeing or do you think these

[17:32] incremental gains that we're sort of

[17:34] talking about and the the more Niche

[17:37] sort of specialized models we need to

[17:39] keep making those improvements to to

[17:41] catch up with you know the potential of

[17:43] what we could actually accomplish

[17:44] absolutely I think that uh you know

[17:47] humans are the longest poll in the 10th

[17:49] year if no human uses any of this stuff

[17:52] it's absolutely useless you can't even

[17:53] come up with that super you know AI

[17:55] thing if nobody's using it it doesn't

[17:56] matter humans take a very long time to

[17:58] change all all of their behaviors habits

[18:00] processes in these companies and so on

[18:03] just very very hard uh so I think with

[18:06] what just we have now there's huge

[18:08] untapped potential and it's not yet been

[18:11] applied in every workpl place in every

[18:14] function in every process in everything

[18:16] that we're doing and and I think we can

[18:18] even improve what we have today with

[18:19] those kind of techniques that we

[18:20] discussed so I think like even if we

[18:22] freeze it and we say hey that's it

[18:23] actually we didn't know how to create a

[18:24] single model that's even better this is

[18:26] the best we'll see in the next 20 years

[18:28] I think it's going to be massive

[18:29] implications on the economy and you know

[18:32] and what we can do and so on so I would

[18:34] still be extremely bullish on this um

[18:37] that that's really truly what I believe

[18:38] in is there something that you see from

[18:40] your seat and and perview that you have

[18:43] that maybe wouldn't be intuitive to the

[18:45] average listener that's you know paying

[18:47] attention to all this stuff but you

[18:49] you're able to see so clearly the same

[18:51] way that you maybe did 10 years ago

[18:53] you're like hey why isn't anyone why

[18:54] does anyone care about this AI thing is

[18:56] there another Insight maybe not at that

[18:58] Quantum but else that you sort of see

[19:00] that you feel like might be mainstream

[19:02] or well understood in a couple years

[19:04] that is underappreciated today yeah I

[19:06] mean I think it's the fact that you're

[19:07] focusing the task I kind of said it you

[19:09] focus the tasks on the repetitive stuff

[19:11] that today is costing you a lot of money

[19:13] and if you can just get the reliabil up

[19:15] on those specific tasks it's massive

[19:18] Improvement for these organizations and

[19:19] it's pretty game-changing we haven't

[19:21] actually reaped that yet those use cases

[19:23] are sort of right now being worked on

[19:26] folks are building them they're not in

[19:27] production it hasn't had impact on all

[19:29] the companies that are using this stuff

[19:31] but it's just around the corner it's

[19:32] like guaranteed it's going to appear uh

[19:34] it will probably take two three years

[19:36] before we see it and then we'll see the

[19:37] impact of it and actually you know I

[19:40] fear or you know suspect that there

[19:42] might be before that we hit the stough

[19:44] of this illusionment and then actually

[19:45] these use cases land and we'll see the

[19:47] companies that are doing that so it's

[19:49] you can see it baking already it's just

[19:50] not in production yet are there use

[19:52] cases that you've seen uh people use

[19:54] data bricks or other know systems for

[19:57] that have gotten you particularly

[19:58] excited back to the regeneron analogy

[20:00] that you were saying 10 years ago maybe

[20:02] maybe something today that you guys see

[20:04] on the field that is exciting or makes

[20:06] you you know particularly um looking

[20:08] forward to the future of what could

[20:09] happen in every vertical in every

[20:11] industry we see lots of lots of use

[20:12] cases you know like Financial Services

[20:14] you know there's so many financial

[20:16] advisers FAS out there you know they

[20:18] basically now we generate automatically

[20:20] for one of our customers you know large

[20:22] Bank automatically in advance you know

[20:24] what advice they should give to you they

[20:25] it's customized they understand

[20:27] everything about you your wealth

[20:28] situation and so on they can give you

[20:29] customized advice you know it's affects

[20:32] you know thousands of thousands of these

[20:33] folks that are doing that right in

[20:35] Insurance sifting through massive

[20:37] massive amounts of uh documents uh to

[20:41] assess risk right it's like they can do

[20:44] it and by the way one thing that people

[20:45] underestimate is that the models are

[20:47] very fast at reading data they're slow

[20:51] at producing text right they're you know

[20:53] much slower the other Insight I would

[20:55] say is like you know that surprising is

[20:56] you know it's probably at least a 10 to

[20:58] one ratio between how much people are

[21:01] using the models to read stuff than to

[21:03] produce so they have when they use data

[21:06] brixs they use us 10 times or 100 times

[21:08] sometimes more or even more to read

[21:11] stuff and then produce very little text

[21:12] or very little data out whereas people

[21:14] have focused on that output that comes

[21:16] out but it's usually much much smaller

[21:18] uh so you know um underwriting is

[21:21] another one that we're seeing uh there's

[21:23] so many going through all the SC filings

[21:24] and figuring out what's happening you

[21:26] know extracting signal so figuring out

[21:29] Alpha uh we see it in all the financial

[21:32] sector um so there's so many use cases

[21:34] in health care electronic medical

[21:35] records there just so many of them

[21:37] they're all handwritten uh being able to

[21:39] actually finding structure in that uh

[21:42] it's you know that's a treasure Trove by

[21:44] itself so use cases around that so

[21:46] there's you know hundreds of hundreds of

[21:48] these you see all the time in every

[21:50] industry they just haven't been

[21:52] productionize yet they're not fully

[21:54] being used by the workforce do you think

[21:57] that readed right uh ratio do you think

[22:00] that stays around that are there any

[22:02] trends that you sort of see as read

[22:04] going up and comparison to WR or you

[22:06] think at some point the the writing and

[22:08] the creation catches up with the reading

[22:10] and summarization I mean hard to see

[22:12] that because uh you know how much are we

[22:14] going to read as humans you know how

[22:16] much we I mean there's only so much and

[22:18] we read slowly right uh whereas having

[22:20] the AI crunch a lot of information um

[22:23] you know so it has that context makes a

[22:25] lot of sense so if anything that

[22:27] probably increases if we can do that

[22:29] faster uh so that that's that's where

[22:31] the trend is headed we're seeing even

[22:33] more and more of that when we look at

[22:34] our data than when we started as you

[22:36] councel customers be it big Enterprises

[22:38] or or smaller ones uh about figuring out

[22:43] where Ai and automation can can exist

[22:46] within the organization and how to um

[22:48] continue to dive deeper into that

[22:50] Journey are there any um takeaways or or

[22:54] key points that you keep hitting that

[22:56] that you feel like hey if you could tell

[22:58] all customers this is how to set up a

[23:00] team or this is how to think about it

[23:02] any Frameworks or Primitives or whatever

[23:04] that you think about first of all you

[23:05] got to get your data strategy right like

[23:08] a lot of companies now want to sort of

[23:10] skip that step and jump straight to the

[23:12] AI and you know the data teams have been

[23:14] at it trying to get the data of their

[23:16] company organized

[23:18] secured uh you know get it in one place

[23:20] so they can actually get access to it

[23:22] not in different silos and you know

[23:24] that's has been a journey and it's not

[23:26] finished work um it hasn't that work has

[23:29] not been on the CEO's radar of the

[23:30] Fortune 500 uh that's you know it's been

[23:33] sort of esoteric topic maybe it was uh

[23:36] sort of worrying about it now the CEOs

[23:39] are waking up after chat GPT and they're

[23:40] saying I need AI it's gamechanging I see

[23:43] it now I've used it myself give me AI uh

[23:46] and they're sort of skipping that step

[23:48] so that's it's extremely important that

[23:49] you go back to the basics uh the data is

[23:53] extremely important so you have to get

[23:55] that in a good place and if you don't

[23:56] have that in a good place you're not

[23:58] going to actually going to be be able to

[23:59] succeed with AI the second thing is

[24:01] focus the use cases of AI that you want

[24:03] to do on where you have a data Advantage

[24:06] so for your company what is your data

[24:07] advantage and Frankly Speaking

[24:09] oftentimes I find myself talking to

[24:11] customers telling them maybe don't do

[24:12] this project and say why not we're very

[24:15] excited about it we're going to do this

[24:16] and that we we are ready to go we'll pay

[24:17] you a lot of money for it and it's like

[24:19] yeah but what's your advantage in this

[24:21] you know there'll be an app for that uh

[24:23] by someone else so let's focus on places

[24:25] where you have a competitive advantage

[24:26] against your competition and it

[24:28] typically has to come back to something

[24:29] you have around the data and you do have

[24:31] it uh so let focus on those use cases

[24:33] because we want our customers to be

[24:34] successful only then long term will be

[24:37] succeed as well so I would say that's

[24:39] the second thing I say the third is uh

[24:43] there's a lot of people problems in

[24:44] large organizations you know it's

[24:47] there's now many people that are

[24:48] fighting over owning AI in the

[24:50] organization like I'm the person who

[24:52] owns AI at our company and so on uh so

[24:55] figuring out a way so that you can get

[24:57] the strategy aligned in large

[24:59] organizations is I know it's boring but

[25:02] this is the hardest part of a large

[25:04] organization with so many different

[25:05] people running in different directions

[25:07] having so many ideas of which vendor to

[25:09] use what kind of models to use what kind

[25:11] of people to hire which project to do uh

[25:14] so as if you can

[25:16] concentrate uh sort of the decision-

[25:19] making to one person in the organization

[25:21] and not have lots of departments have

[25:24] political fights over it it streamlines

[25:26] and moves things faster typically you

[25:28] actually have the head of that

[25:29] department being a change agent person

[25:31] it's someone that doesn't do things that

[25:34] everyone will love they'll come in and

[25:35] make the difficult decisions streamline

[25:38] the data processing the security around

[25:40] the Privacy around it because

[25:42] everybody's worried about that and then

[25:44] focus on those use cases that actually

[25:46] matter for that organization this is as

[25:49] important as a technology I care a lot

[25:50] about technology and geek out on that

[25:52] but this is just as important projects

[25:53] will get not funded or they get stuck in

[25:56] security or they go nowhere cuz

[25:58] different departments are fighting each

[25:59] other so we need to overcome these

[26:00] things as well this is why I'm saying

[26:02] it's going to take a few years before we

[26:03] see the impact of these things as you

[26:05] think about the the landscape and uh the

[26:07] term that you used earlier to sort of

[26:09] talk about was it compound what was the

[26:11] compound compound data system yeah

[26:14] compound agent systems um how do you

[26:16] think about what areas to potentially

[26:18] pursue um there's a bunch of venture

[26:21] companies in spaces like inference or

[26:24] evals or whatever it is like as you

[26:26] think about different areas to

[26:27] potentially into for data breaks as a

[26:29] business how do you evaluate uh no pun

[26:32] intended I guess th those those markets

[26:35] to potentially pursue yeah makes sense

[26:36] look it's just for us it makes a lot of

[26:38] sense is you already have all your data

[26:40] with data bricks you already trust us

[26:42] that it's secure you know that we can

[26:44] handle the security the Privacy so the

[26:46] question is what's really adjacent to

[26:48] that and for me as a CEO where is it we

[26:50] can actually bring extra value to the

[26:51] customer that they otherwise couldn't

[26:53] get elsewhere typically comes back to

[26:54] data that they have with us already so

[26:56] typically comes with governance around

[26:58] that data uh with guard rails around

[27:01] that data you know you don't want to

[27:02] build uh this actually happened with a

[27:04] customer they had a chat bot and if you

[27:06] asked it what's the best you know car I

[27:08] could buy and it this was a car

[27:10] manufacturer it recommended a

[27:11] competitor's car you know uh so how do

[27:13] you put guard rails around that uh you

[27:15] know how do you deal with pii data how

[27:17] do you deal with AI regulation that's

[27:19] coming a lot of this we can standardize

[27:20] in datab bricks so makes sense we can

[27:22] like automatically produce documentation

[27:24] so you're compliant with the regulation

[27:26] that's coming we can put guard rails so

[27:27] that doesn't do those kind of things and

[27:30] since we have the data we can create

[27:32] this data loop so that you get this

[27:34] flywheel of when they use the model we

[27:36] create the evals and automatically feed

[27:39] it back to making this model smarter and

[27:41] smarter and doing that it seems we can

[27:43] do that because they already have the

[27:45] data with us so it's just advantageous

[27:47] for us to do that um I think in this

[27:50] space like for startups they should

[27:51] focus on the applications I think

[27:53] applications are going to be where a lot

[27:55] of value in the AI space is going to

[27:56] crew in the future we'd love to be their

[27:58] infrastructure so they use us for their

[28:00] data processing for their governance and

[28:02] for their AI uh the applications I mean

[28:05] there's a lot of creativity there's a

[28:06] lot of things that you're seeing

[28:07] happening I can't predict what's going

[28:09] to be the apps that actually going to

[28:10] win in the future it's kind of like in

[28:12] 2000 trying to predict predict Facebook

[28:14] or Twitter no one could have done that

[28:16] no one ever would have said oh you know

[28:17] this is going to be a company that does

[28:19] you know 140 character tweets it's going

[28:21] to be the same thing now so we just want

[28:22] to be that infrastructure for them so

[28:24] they can build their AI systems on top

[28:26] of us and we help them with that data

[28:28] flywheel if we back up a little bit um

[28:30] to the original early days of of spark

[28:32] so we talked about the Netflix

[28:33] competition and that uh I had heard that

[28:36] maybe you tried to actually sell the

[28:37] technology in the early days and there

[28:39] weren't really any takers can you just

[28:41] go back to that early uh story like what

[28:44] did you see and what was your path to

[28:48] getting it off the ground into some

[28:50] commercial entity yeah I mean what was

[28:52] really happening is that we were seeing

[28:53] that the Silicon Valley Tech companies

[28:55] were leveraging AI this is 2009 or 10 we

[28:58] were seeing what Facebook was doing uh

[29:00] we were saying what Google was doing and

[29:03] it was very clear that doing AI on the

[29:05] data is going to be the most important

[29:07] thing and at the time everybody was

[29:09] stuck on doing basic analytics backwards

[29:12] looking call it bi business intelligence

[29:15] which is backwards looking like how was

[29:16] my Revenue last week and they were

[29:18] excited that they could do that really

[29:19] really fast but we were asking hey what

[29:21] about what's your Revenue going to be

[29:23] next week Ai and there was just not much

[29:27] appetite for that

[29:28] uh at the time and we went around and we

[29:30] tried to push the technology out because

[29:31] we just wanted to do research but it was

[29:33] very hard to actually get anyone to

[29:34] actually see this you know you might

[29:35] remember the phrase it was the Hadoop

[29:37] Wars Hadoop days it was impossible to

[29:39] get anyone's attention for that stuff so

[29:41] it was kind of a little bit out of

[29:42] Despair that we we started the company

[29:45] and said look if we don't do it

[29:46] ourselves uh no one El's going to do it

[29:48] I remember actually one of our first

[29:50] customers uh we said hey this is open

[29:52] source just take it because we don't

[29:53] want to make money on this and I said no

[29:56] you got to charge us for it because we

[29:58] want an Enterprise that's behind this uh

[30:00] and that's kind of when we realized that

[30:02] okay there needs to be like an

[30:03] Enterprise business no one else is going

[30:05] to do that we probably have to do it

[30:06] ourselves was it an issue of um just

[30:09] just pure Focus for these vendors or was

[30:12] there something from a data structure

[30:15] standpoint that needed to actually

[30:16] happen to have the market evolved to the

[30:18] point that they actually were able to do

[30:20] a lot of the things that you wanted them

[30:21] to do I think there's these hype cycles

[30:23] that come and everybody's just focused

[30:24] on something so that era was that Hado

[30:27] hype cycle and they were obsessed with

[30:28] it and we couldn't for the life of us

[30:29] tell us AI is more interesting it's just

[30:31] it's you know you open the newspaper and

[30:33] everything is just about that and it's

[30:35] happening now too right it's like I

[30:36] think the market works like that and to

[30:39] create a successful company you have to

[30:40] kind of bet on something that's

[30:42] non-consensus at the time and you have

[30:44] to be right about it so um for us it was

[30:47] AI it was the cloud it was open source

[30:49] those were the things that we were

[30:50] excited about but there wasn't much

[30:52] excitement around that and actually we

[30:53] were told that this is not going to work

[30:55] all the data is going to be on premises

[30:58] um you know open source you cannot

[30:59] monetize it um and so on and so forth so

[31:03] um I think it's similar now right um

[31:06] were you intellectually I I I had heard

[31:08] a story that you that a customer was

[31:10] going to offer you I don't know if it

[31:11] was seven figures or eight figures or

[31:13] something to build an on-prem version of

[31:15] the product and you rejected it at a

[31:17] point in time that maybe you could have

[31:18] used this now now less so but at that

[31:21] point in time you definitely could have

[31:22] used the seven or eight figures or

[31:23] whatever it was did you just see this as

[31:26] an inevitable path you were building

[31:27] toward words and therefore anything but

[31:30] that was a distraction along the way or

[31:32] what was that philosophical decision

[31:33] yeah 100% like our view was we have to

[31:37] have an asymmetric bet on something that

[31:39] no one else believes in and we better be

[31:41] right about it that's the only way so if

[31:43] we're going to go on Prem and do what

[31:44] everyone else is doing then there are

[31:46] way bigger sharks that can do them than

[31:48] us and then this is going to fizzle out

[31:50] and it's not going to work so yeah it

[31:52] was a month or so in to my CEO job 2016

[31:55] that one of the largest banks told me

[31:58] you need to bring this stuff on premise

[32:00] and I said no we're not going to do that

[32:01] and they said well how much how much

[32:03] what say how much would we pay you for

[32:05] said we're not going to do it and it's

[32:06] said five million I said we're not going

[32:08] to do it and I said 10 I said we're not

[32:10] going to do it they said 20 I'll give

[32:11] you 20 right now and at the time 2016

[32:15] you know I guess we ended the year um

[32:17] with 10 million Revenue that year so you

[32:20] know 20 million Revenue was a lot uh but

[32:22] the idea was like if you go on Prem

[32:24] they're much bigger companies so we have

[32:26] to have an asymmetric bet uh that we

[32:28] believe in and we continue double down

[32:29] on uh and then once that bet becomes

[32:32] true we'll be big enough that it's too

[32:34] hard for others to catch up with us

[32:36] similar thing as I said is going to

[32:38] happen in this Ai and llm era right now

[32:41] um I think you have to pick something

[32:44] that you think is different uh than the

[32:46] rest of Market uh and then bet on it and

[32:49] then hopefully you're right as um as you

[32:52] reflect on the journey one of the

[32:54] stories that I had heard was um giving a

[32:57] lot of credit to to Ben horror wits in

[33:00] actually turning this into a business

[33:02] can you tell that story typically I

[33:03] don't allow other VC plugs but I thought

[33:05] it was an interesting one that he

[33:06] actually was uh pushing you guys to

[33:09] think big and turn this into a

[33:10] commercial product yeah I mean look we

[33:11] came out of the research lab we really

[33:13] wanted to raise only two three $400,000

[33:16] seed and just Cod away for a year or so

[33:19] and he's the one that pushed hard no

[33:20] let's do the series a and I want to be

[33:22] exclusive

[33:23] investor and um you know we were

[33:26] actually not very excited about it but

[33:27] then he gave us a price we couldn't

[33:28] refuse and he said no go big and we gave

[33:30] us you know 14 million at the time which

[33:32] is a lot of money uh back then I know

[33:34] it's not much these days uh and he said

[33:37] go go go go go so he really pushed us go

[33:39] aggressive disrupt the market think big

[33:43] uh you know he always was a couple of

[33:45] orders of magnitude bigger sort of

[33:47] vision for data bricks than we ever had

[33:50] like whatever was our biggest grandio

[33:53] vision of data bricks he always was a

[33:55] couple of orders of magnitude ahead and

[33:56] was pushing aggressively saying no no no

[33:58] this you're thinking too small like way

[33:59] too small and I think you really truly

[34:01] believed it as well so that kind of set

[34:03] the tone from the early days uh for us

[34:05] cuz the early Founders I don't know if

[34:07] you remember these numbers but you guys

[34:09] bet you remember the actual numberb so

[34:10] so what were the bets for the early well

[34:12] I mean like we were in around the table

[34:13] when we started the company said hey

[34:14] what's like a great outcome for the

[34:16] company and I think when we went around

[34:18] the table the numbers were something

[34:20] along the lines of like 150 million exit

[34:22] for us or 200 and someone said 250 and

[34:24] so on uh so that's how we were thinking

[34:27] and Ben was immediately like no no no

[34:28] billions for sure we're going to do and

[34:31] then when we got to that you know it was

[34:33] like this is easily going to be a

[34:34] hundred billion doll company and you

[34:35] know now where we are now he's like

[34:37] definitely trillion is what you need to

[34:39] think about uh and you know I would also

[34:41] give credit for Mark andreon in one of

[34:43] the meetings I think we early days we

[34:45] said um he said what's your biggest

[34:46] bottleneck I think this was

[34:48] 2017 and said hey we can't hire

[34:50] Engineers we can't get the engineers

[34:53] from Facebook and Google they're just

[34:55] too expensive and he said huh what's so

[34:58] what's so Fang is the problem and I said

[34:59] yeah Fang is the problem and I okay so

[35:01] you just need to add yourself to that

[35:02] list it needs to be Fang DB H and that's

[35:05] it and then he moved on but after that

[35:07] meeting we're like yeah okay he kind of

[35:08] is right we should actually just offer

[35:10] up and you know hire those people and

[35:13] become like one of those Tech magnets

[35:15] and it changed our mindset actually we

[35:16] went back we changed our compensation we

[35:19] changed how we hire just based on that

[35:21] one comment I'm curious like at a

[35:23] tactical level I mean that's very

[35:25] aspirational it sounds great uh but but

[35:27] like in changing the compensation or

[35:29] thinking bigger like what did you then

[35:31] go do we literally went back and moved

[35:33] the compensation for engineering to 9th

[35:35] percenti of the market you know we did

[35:37] the math and we saw how much is it going

[35:39] to cost us are we going to be able to do

[35:41] this is it going to be is it something

[35:44] that we can afford as a company what's

[35:45] the dilution going to be this was a long

[35:46] time ago and actually when we ran the

[35:49] Cals we were surprised that actually we

[35:51] can do this and it's sustainable and it

[35:53] was surprising to us we're data

[35:54] companies we crunched the data and all

[35:56] the numbers um but we we found is that

[35:58] you know it's really your market cap

[36:00] divided by number of employees that's

[36:02] how Equity Rich you are when you're

[36:04] paying someone equity and these

[36:05] companies had a lot of employees so then

[36:07] it turned out actually we are actually

[36:09] richer than we think if you take our

[36:10] market cap and divide it by the number

[36:11] of

[36:12] employees uh because that's you know

[36:14] that's not how you're doing financially

[36:15] that's not about your Revenue growth but

[36:16] that's about what you you know what

[36:18] could you offer someone in equity and it

[36:20] turned out that actually it's absolutely

[36:22] within our reach to do it so let's

[36:23] explore it a little bit and it started

[36:25] working and then we were able to hire

[36:26] the people that we couldn't hire before

[36:28] and they came in and they completely

[36:29] revamped what we were doing with the

[36:30] product we just could increase the

[36:32] feature velocity and The Innovation

[36:34] cycle at data bricks massively and that

[36:37] actually helped us kind of slowly start

[36:39] separating from the pack because in 2017

[36:41] if you had talked to us you know we

[36:43] would have been one of the startups

[36:44] among hundreds of other ones out there

[36:46] uh so these small things kind of that

[36:49] they did to push us think really really

[36:51] big go way bigger and we did that but we

[36:53] always kind of did it judiciously we

[36:54] didn't want to kind of go crazy and you

[36:57] know burn down the bank account we

[36:58] wanted to be careful about it datab

[37:00] bricks was founded in 2013 is that right

[37:03] and for the first couple years you

[37:04] weren't the CEO what were you doing

[37:06] through that the first couple years in

[37:08] the journey and then what was the

[37:10] impetus for you to step in and become

[37:12] the CEO yeah I was uh you know running

[37:14] product and Engineering uh which I loved

[37:16] and actually in that phase it made a lot

[37:18] of sense because you know what do you do

[37:19] the first two three years of a company

[37:20] when we start a startup you want to get

[37:22] product Market fit build something that

[37:23] just works uh so that was the focus for

[37:26] us just how do we get one customer that

[37:28] wants to use this and then how do we get

[37:30] a customer that wants to repeatedly use

[37:32] it and then how do we get a customer

[37:33] that repeatedly uses and pays us for it

[37:36] and um so that was the first two three

[37:38] years of the

[37:38] focus the technology that we had

[37:41] innovated with with spark exploded in

[37:43] 2015 and um you know at that point we

[37:47] felt like we had succeeded but we just

[37:48] didn't have any monetization so we went

[37:51] through it difficult time in 15 we had

[37:52] to figure out okay if we can't monetize

[37:54] maybe there is nothing here uh and the

[37:57] company kind of went through a little

[37:58] bit of um sort of introspection and then

[38:02] we said okay let's kind of do a little

[38:03] bit of reset of some of the things and

[38:05] rethink some of the stuff and start a

[38:07] new in 2016 so like M CEO in 2016 and we

[38:11] made a bunch of changes that actually

[38:12] started helping us with monetization

[38:14] initially were you the interim CEO or

[38:17] were you the CEO and they were still

[38:18] talking to other uh potential outside

[38:21] candidates well I thought I was well

[38:23] first of all I heard through the grap

[38:24] fine that they're interviewing people so

[38:25] I found out okay they're actually

[38:26] interviewing other EXN folks so that's

[38:28] were you the CEO at the time or but they

[38:30] were like hey do you want to be the CEO

[38:31] I was like sure and then I found out

[38:33] okay they're actually interviewing other

[38:34] people all right they didn't tell me

[38:35] about that but then eventually I was

[38:37] like okay I think I am C the CEO they've

[38:38] announced it to the company I am the CEO

[38:39] I'm running it but then I kind of you

[38:41] know my compensation didn't change and I

[38:43] learned kind of soon that hey I'm

[38:46] actually interim CEO I didn't know that

[38:48] you didn't have the title until yeah so

[38:50] then it's it's turned out no no no

[38:52] actually it was just a test period and

[38:53] then eventually I would say after one

[38:55] year um I kind of think they really kind

[38:58] of like okay no we're going to go with

[38:59] him for so the first when you came in in

[39:01] 2016 there were three things that you

[39:04] kind of focused on uh in it sounds like

[39:06] monetization was one of them as well but

[39:09] uh can you talk through what those three

[39:11] were I think it was upleveling the

[39:12] management team sort of changing the

[39:14] focus of the the customer type and the

[39:16] monetization yeah Enterprise sales total

[39:19] pivot into Enterprise B2B we were plg I

[39:22] know it's still hot everybody wants to

[39:23] build plg companies but we learned a

[39:25] hard way after two three years that plg

[39:27] doesn't

[39:27] work um might work for very few

[39:31] companies it's a great thing we still do

[39:33] plg uh but if you guess what if you want

[39:36] to sell a data platform where you want

[39:38] to manage the most sensitive data of a

[39:40] large organization uh you need to get

[39:42] the Buy in of that organization nobody's

[39:45] going to just swipe a credit card and

[39:46] start giving their data to you and

[39:47] you're going to succeed so plg just

[39:49] won't work in that model um in B2B in

[39:52] general it's hard if you want to have

[39:53] big contracts with large Enterprises plg

[39:56] probably don't work does not work

[39:58] um so um so number one going all in on

[40:00] Enterprise sales uh we had tried earlier

[40:03] to just be this plg product Le growth uh

[40:06] the second thing is upleveling the

[40:07] management so we up leveled all the

[40:09] exact team like every person on the

[40:11] exact team was new so I basically got a

[40:13] new exact team um that had much more

[40:15] experience they knew what they were

[40:16] doing and a little bit went more with uh

[40:19] experience over just hey we're just

[40:22] going to be smart phds that can figure

[40:23] this out on our own we went instead with

[40:26] you know someone who's done sales for 20

[40:27] 30 years or someone has done marketing

[40:29] at scale at Oracle knows how marketing

[40:31] is done and so on so that really helped

[40:33] also with the execution because I would

[40:35] say we were really weak on goto Market

[40:37] we were great at product Innovation

[40:39] research uh so those really helped and

[40:41] then a change to how we actually

[40:44] innovate in open source just open

[40:46] sourcing everything in giving it away is

[40:47] not going to work so we need proprietary

[40:49] secret s sauce that we're not just

[40:51] giving away to the hyperscalers so that

[40:54] was critical also in changing and that's

[40:56] difficult to do if you're a pure open

[40:57] source company you come from Academia

[41:00] it's it's it's difficult to get all your

[41:02] employees to be all in on that uh but it

[41:05] was the only way to succeed we wouldn't

[41:06] have been around if we hadn't done that

[41:07] pivot did you have those views as your

[41:11] running product and you sort of came in

[41:13] prepared to do that or was there some

[41:14] point of introspection that ultimately

[41:16] led to those conclusions yeah I think 15

[41:19] we were not doing super well and in 15

[41:21] it was sort of like okay we trying plg

[41:23] it's clearly not working right yeah we

[41:26] don't want to do Enterprise B2B because

[41:27] we're not excellent at it we don't have

[41:29] experience in it but you know uh we

[41:31] ended

[41:32] 2015 with 1.6 million Revenue 2015 so if

[41:37] we only have 1.5 1.6 million revenue

[41:40] from what we could glean from blogs and

[41:42] whatnot and Enterprise salesperson can

[41:44] sell a million dollars a million and a

[41:46] half of software that's just one AE why

[41:49] don't we hire three of them and try it

[41:51] out what do we have to lose so that kind

[41:53] of emerged in 2015 the other thing was

[41:56] it was very clear that no matter what

[41:57] what we did in the Innovation cycle side

[41:59] the hyperscalers immediately had the

[42:01] same thing they would just pick that and

[42:03] in fact they would add a little bit

[42:05] stuff on top of it and then they had the

[42:07] the whole platform the whole Cloud so

[42:10] they were always the good enough vendor

[42:11] so the customers were like well you're

[42:13] great you have great Innovation but I

[42:15] can also get it from the hyperscaler I'm

[42:17] going to try that first because I

[42:18] already have a contract with these folks

[42:20] I got security approvals I've already

[42:21] paid them a bunch of money try that

[42:23] first and if it's not good enough I'll

[42:25] come back to you so pretty clear that we

[42:27] have to be able to articulate then yeah

[42:29] you can go over there but you won't get

[42:30] XYZ if you go over there like we have

[42:32] XYZ that they don't have and so if you

[42:34] couldn't articulate that then there was

[42:37] nothing you could give your sellers to

[42:38] sell um and then you know it was the

[42:41] experience that we were lacking so I

[42:42] think through throughout the hardships

[42:44] of 2015 kind of made it pretty clear

[42:46] that we have to try something new and

[42:48] these three directions seem to be pretty

[42:50] viable I mean the one that stands out

[42:52] the most as like potentially a one-way

[42:54] door is the the licensing or

[42:56] monetization shift and it's very

[42:59] different than the the culture I would

[43:02] say of the people that are very uh open-

[43:04] Source purists in some way was that was

[43:07] that a debated decision in a very

[43:09] meaningful way or was it just kind of

[43:11] declarative hey guys we have to do this

[43:13] to be able to build a business I think

[43:14] when I took over I was just a little bit

[43:16] more forceful in what needs to be done

[43:19] but it was big debate internally and I

[43:22] made it pretty clear I think I I used

[43:24] the analogy and I said hey we have a gun

[43:26] and it has one bullet left in it we not

[43:29] going to do thousand things we have like

[43:30] one bullet left we better aim it really

[43:32] clearly and we better hit the target if

[43:34] we don't we're done here and so I made

[43:36] it pretty clear that this is existential

[43:38] the things that we're going to do and um

[43:41] and I think when I kind of got people to

[43:42] wake up because you know in the startup

[43:44] days you're excited you're doing stuff

[43:45] and but if nobody makes it clear to you

[43:48] that hey we're actually GNA go out of

[43:49] business in a couple years it's not all

[43:50] great just because we have a big

[43:52] valuation I think people got in line and

[43:55] and started thinking about okay what are

[43:56] the ways we can actually do this did

[43:57] they quickly start showing up in the the

[43:59] business or did it take a few quarters

[44:00] no I I think pretty soon the engineers

[44:02] started thinking and I made it very

[44:04] clear to them is that this is great that

[44:05] you built this it's literally available

[44:07] now also on the hyperscalers cloud so

[44:09] what's the differentiation literally and

[44:10] I made it very viscerally clear to them

[44:12] and I shared it we had a extreme

[44:14] transparency culture and make it really

[44:16] clear so get them to buy and let them

[44:18] understand themselves that we can't win

[44:20] we're guaranteed going to lose if we

[44:22] continue this way um and you know they

[44:24] kind of soon got it that we want to be

[44:25] successful here so they start coming up

[44:27] with innovations that we're going to

[44:29] this maybe we don't need to open source

[44:31] now as you think about expanding into

[44:33] new products uh I've heard you actually

[44:34] will set up uh different teams for each

[44:37] product as it gets going what have you

[44:39] learned about product management and

[44:40] organization as uh as you can to scale

[44:43] and iterate on these different product

[44:44] areas yeah I think that when you build a

[44:46] product zero to one you kind of have to

[44:49] do the same thing that you did in the

[44:51] original kind of first two three years

[44:52] of the company um so there's a lot of

[44:54] processes in any company once you're

[44:56] over50 50 employees let alone thousands

[44:59] um so you got to cut that and say look

[45:02] for new products you don't need to

[45:04] satisfy all the security stuff you don't

[45:05] need to have all the processes have a

[45:07] small core team that iterates really

[45:08] really quickly uh figure out first of

[45:11] all who's the sort of Innovator type

[45:14] that you have in those early startups

[45:15] put them on the project these are people

[45:17] that are not necessarily good at when

[45:19] the company scales and they're leading

[45:21] mature products you have to have one

[45:22] such anchor person that you put

[45:24] everything around and you put them in

[45:25] charge they start building that product

[45:27] product uh and then you let them iterate

[45:28] really quickly so get them off the

[45:30] iteration cycle that the big company

[45:32] goes on but get them on this much

[45:34] quicker smaller one and you know

[45:36] encourage them to just iterate inner Dev

[45:38] Loop outer Dev Loop that's super super

[45:40] fast and just focus on getting users and

[45:42] getting product Market fit once that

[45:44] happens you can kind of move it back

[45:46] into the Mother Ship uh so you know

[45:49] ideally even do it outside of the whole

[45:51] product if you can so we have a product

[45:53] right now called Genie which lets you

[45:54] just you ask in English questions and it

[45:56] can answer immediately produces it

[45:58] understands all the semantics of your

[46:00] data we call it data intelligence so it

[46:02] understands your data and it then

[46:04] programs and ask the questions and give

[46:06] you just straight up the answer but to

[46:08] know that it's not hallucinating you can

[46:10] actually see how it coded it up and

[46:12] behind the scenes and so on that product

[46:13] we actually just built it completely

[46:15] outside of data's codebase and it didn't

[46:17] satisfy any of this stuff we didn't

[46:18] build on anything we just iterated it

[46:20] quickly just do that outside of the norm

[46:23] like a startup almost and then only when

[46:26] we saw that the results are really good

[46:27] and people like it we went through the

[46:29] kind of painful process of okay let's

[46:31] rewrite it let's move it into the

[46:32] mothership so it's almost like an

[46:34] acquisition at that point happens and

[46:36] you have to integrate it into the whole

[46:38] system and make it secure and so on so

[46:40] you'll give people autonomy to make the

[46:42] decisions on not not the shared

[46:44] Primitives necessarily or if you guys

[46:46] are using some type of I don't know

[46:48] single sign on or whatever Cloud

[46:49] structure underneath you'll get people

[46:51] full autonomy to do it and then you'll

[46:52] come back and reconcile it once it

[46:54] actually finds product Market fit

[46:55] literally do it outside in a separate

[46:57] repository do it in a g separate GitHub

[46:59] repository outside of the big system and

[47:01] do it you know iterate very quickly is

[47:03] the most important thing because that's

[47:04] what you're doing as a startup as a

[47:06] startup you operate three to four times

[47:08] I've seen it we've done Acquisitions and

[47:09] if you measure it the startups move

[47:10] three to four times faster than you know

[47:13] a company like datab brick and I think

[47:14] we move very fast and we're very

[47:15] Innovative but still it takes us three

[47:18] four times longer why is it it's the

[47:20] security processes it's the legal sign

[47:23] off it's making sure that it works on

[47:25] all the clouds in of the environments

[47:27] and the biggest thing that slows you

[47:29] down is that you have thousands of

[47:30] thousands of customers that you can't

[47:32] regress um so you got to unshackle the

[47:35] new products otherwise you're just going

[47:36] to move too slowly and that's what

[47:38] you're we're seeing honestly the really

[47:39] really big companies they operate that

[47:41] way it takes them too long that's why

[47:42] you have startups in the ecosystem so

[47:44] you have to kind of go back and

[47:45] reproduce the kind of environment that

[47:48] you had when you had a small startup I

[47:50] I'm curious uh so so now you're coming

[47:53] up on I guess N9 years-ish at the CEO

[47:56] job is that right um as you reflect on

[47:58] like your leadership style today you

[48:00] sort of seem like the canonical leader

[48:02] of of data bricks and it's like the job

[48:04] that you've always done I assume

[48:05] leadership style has kind of evolved in

[48:07] some ways over the course of of this

[48:09] period of time are there anything that

[48:10] you wish you could anything you could

[48:11] wish you could go back and tell your

[48:14] earlier self taking the CEO job for the

[48:15] first time or maybe your earliest

[48:17] founder self when you sort of stepping

[48:18] into the seat yeah I mean I think that

[48:20] you would want to grow leaders earlier

[48:23] on like build trust with few leaders

[48:25] that you groom and continue doing that

[48:27] because what you find nine 10 years

[48:29] later and I have a lot of awesome

[48:30] co-founders that are still active and

[48:32] they run a company where it's almost a

[48:34] partnership where we run it together uh

[48:36] but it's not that many people like you

[48:38] know even though we're almost 8,000

[48:39] employees how many people are there that

[48:41] are really can really help you build the

[48:43] business together it's it's hard to find

[48:45] those leaders that build you trust uh

[48:48] with them and you know grow the company

[48:49] with so I would just invest more in that

[48:51] much more actively and always be Lookout

[48:53] on the lookout for those kind of people

[48:55] in the company know we were just busy

[48:57] executing and we didn't pay attention

[48:58] too much to that maybe so that's one

[49:00] thing I would do differently um the

[49:02] second thing I would do differently is

[49:06] um when these trade-off decisions come

[49:08] up and it's really hard to decide do we

[49:10] do do we go on Prem or not or whatever

[49:12] it is um bet make a bet that you know is

[49:16] much more for the future don't worry so

[49:19] much about you know the implications

[49:21] that it has on our finances or on the

[49:22] revenue and don't like don't let

[49:24] short-termism creep in in easy to say

[49:28] now but in the early days when you're

[49:30] it's far from clear that you're going to

[49:32] be successful as a company and you know

[49:35] the VCS are asking you how's it going

[49:36] you have your board meetings they're

[49:37] looking for your Revenue targets they

[49:39] they are super obsessed saying how's

[49:41] that is it hockey sticking is it going

[49:42] up what's it looking at how do you

[49:44] compare with others in the industry

[49:45] continue making the bets on the future

[49:48] and don't get carried away on those

[49:49] numbers uh that's another advice I would

[49:52] give because we took many shortcuts that

[49:55] backfired um they were not wor doing we

[49:57] kind of knew it that this was a shortcut

[49:59] but it was like it was worth it cuz you

[50:00] know this going to bring so much revenue

[50:02] if we just take this shortcut I would

[50:04] have avoided many of those shortcuts now

[50:06] um you know uh air on the side of the

[50:08] future than the present now of course

[50:11] maybe it's path dependent and I'm saying

[50:12] it just because we're where we are if we

[50:13] had done the things that I'm saying we

[50:14] should do we wouldn't have succeeded but

[50:17] uh I still kind of on balance feel like

[50:20] we could have been more futuristic in

[50:22] our bets than we were I get the feeling

[50:24] you you focus on um empowering

[50:26] individual leaders within your

[50:28] organization and having them um

[50:31] deputized to make the best decisions for

[50:34] the organization rather than uh you

[50:36] serving as a central hub for for each

[50:39] department is that a fair character I

[50:40] think it's both I think I also

[50:41] micromanaged them okay maybe they would

[50:44] disagree yeah yeah they would probably

[50:45] not say Hey how do you think about that

[50:46] tension between um uh you know a central

[50:50] figure that's able to make definitive

[50:52] decisions that sort of sit across an

[50:53] organization versus more

[50:55] decentralization and empowerment at an

[50:57] individual level yeah I mean you get

[50:59] more clarity if it's one person and it's

[51:01] more

[51:02] consistent and you know that's great the

[51:06] disadvantage is that it slows things

[51:08] down and it bottlenecks things uh and

[51:10] it's maybe less empowering so you have

[51:12] to strike a balance and you have to do

[51:14] it in places like you know you build

[51:15] trust over time you figure out which are

[51:17] the parts which you can completely

[51:18] delegate and they're going to do an

[51:19] excellent job and you know they're

[51:21] probably better than you at it so don't

[51:23] pretend that you're better than them uh

[51:24] and what are the are areas where you

[51:26] really need to deep dive uh and then

[51:28] there are some areas that there's things

[51:29] that only you can do as a CEO like you

[51:31] know it's it's literally tiebreaking uh

[51:34] it might sound silly but over time

[51:36] overlapping product areas appear and you

[51:38] get leaders that are kind of building

[51:39] similarish things and the vent diagram

[51:43] intersects and if you leave it to them

[51:45] no matter how many times you tell them

[51:46] you know figure out how to unify this do

[51:49] one we're not going to have two similar

[51:51] offerings they're not going to be able

[51:52] to do it them on their own so you got to

[51:54] step in and push so that you got to use

[51:55] the CEO card judiciously I think that

[51:58] matters a lot and you can make build a

[51:59] much simpler product so I think if you

[52:01] want really simple unified product that

[52:03] makes sense one person uh makes much

[52:06] much more sense you just have to watch

[52:07] out for bottlenecking things and slowing

[52:09] things down why is the willingness to

[52:11] say the same thing over and over again

[52:13] important part of the CEO's job in your

[52:14] mind because I think people are not

[52:16] paying attention to what you're saying

[52:17] like you know we all have busy lives

[52:19] we're paying attention to our own life

[52:20] you know I didn't even notice this thing

[52:22] that you said I wasn't even there or

[52:23] maybe you said it I didn't really rock

[52:24] it I was on my phone and I had actually

[52:26] fire that day and I was having other

[52:28] issues that I was dealing with so I

[52:29] didn't really I didn't really

[52:30] internalize it I didn't really get it so

[52:32] it's many many times you tell someone

[52:33] something for a third time and then only

[52:35] then you notice that they are like you

[52:36] know and then they repeat it back to you

[52:38] as if it's like they came up with it

[52:40] that's great um I think it's just you

[52:42] got to repeat it but what I try to do is

[52:44] figure out a way to repeat it in

[52:45] different ways don't repeat it the same

[52:47] way all the time it gets boring and old

[52:49] challenge yourself and come up with a

[52:50] new angle find a customer that says the

[52:52] same thing that you want to say uh or

[52:54] use case that's a little bit different

[52:56] use different slides make new slides um

[52:59] and you'll be surprised because you know

[53:00] people didn't really get it the first

[53:01] time they'll say oh this was completely

[53:02] awesome what you just said now even

[53:04] though you're like well that's literally

[53:05] what I said like a month ago but I just

[53:07] refurbished it a little bit so I think

[53:08] it's super important being truth seeking

[53:10] I think is one of your values is that

[53:12] right um how do you implement that in

[53:14] practice or how does that be manifest

[53:15] itself as a cultural um cultural

[53:18] practice for you guys make sure in the

[53:20] hiring process that you test folks on

[53:21] Truth seeking you know it's not that

[53:23] hard actually to ask someone you know

[53:25] tell me what's your biggest screw up you

[53:27] know tell me when you really made a

[53:28] mistake who did you really not hire well

[53:31] why did you make that mistake how was it

[53:32] and so on push them push them push them

[53:34] to you see you know until they get

[53:35] uncomfortable do they start come up with

[53:37] lots of excuses well I really actually

[53:39] didn't want to hire this person but I my

[53:41] boss made me hire them and that was a

[53:42] bad H I knew it but yeah that was a

[53:44] mistake I made but technically my boss's

[53:45] mistake so like you know keep pushing

[53:47] them and you can in the interview

[53:48] process actually sus out if someone is

[53:50] TR seeking and honest or whether they're

[53:53] trying to a little bit you know make it

[53:55] look much nicer um you know so that's

[53:59] that's number one number two don't

[54:01] promote the people in the company that

[54:02] are not trth seeking like at least if

[54:04] you made the mistake of hiring them in

[54:06] then at least make sure you don't

[54:06] promote them so in the promotions of the

[54:09] company make sure that you're really

[54:10] evaluating the cultural values like

[54:12] really do it it's easy to have the

[54:13] culture values but are you evaluating

[54:14] the promotion I have a rockstar Rockstar

[54:17] is doing great they move the needle on

[54:18] the business should they get the

[54:19] promotion or not you don't want to be

[54:21] the person say well wait a minute can we

[54:22] like look at if they were truth seeking

[54:23] oh they're not let's not promote them

[54:25] it's like are you out of your mind this

[54:26] person had huge impact on the company

[54:28] yeah but they're not truth seeking but

[54:30] you have if you mean it if you want that

[54:31] to be the culture you have to actually

[54:32] do that uh in the promotion and then of

[54:35] course if it's extreme case we might

[54:38] have to part ways you have to do that as

[54:39] well you can't have people around that

[54:41] don't fit the culture um so that's what

[54:43] I would

[54:44] say you spend 30 to 40% of your time on

[54:47] on hiring is that right one of the

[54:49] things you said is that you um when

[54:51] you're hiring Executives you'll you'll

[54:54] just find reasons to keep in touch and

[54:56] find bunch of different touch points can

[54:57] you maybe talk through that as a

[54:59] philosophy or how you go about doing it

[55:00] yeah I think actually the bigger

[55:02] philosophy is that I don't believe in

[55:04] interviews uh because I think some

[55:05] people interview well and they might not

[55:07] be good at all and some people interview

[55:09] really poorly but it might be excellent

[55:11] so I actually just think it's a very

[55:12] noisy um Channel you can't there's not

[55:16] that much value in it uh so then what

[55:19] can you do um one of the things this is

[55:21] the one that you mentioned but there are

[55:22] other ones that we use as well is I try

[55:24] to actually have them do the job

[55:26] and I think we think oh you know in

[55:28] programming we can do that ask them to

[55:29] program this thing and then if they do

[55:31] it well but we can't do it for any other

[55:32] job and I disagree with that just if

[55:35] you're hiring someone for head of

[55:36] marketing work with them to fix

[55:38] something that's broken in marketing

[55:39] right now whatever it is if it's a

[55:41] Personnel problem or if it's the web

[55:42] page which the product marketing

[55:44] positioning work with them call them

[55:46] call them you know in the evening call

[55:47] them you know in the morning ask them go

[55:49] through it like work with them basically

[55:51] make them do the job as if they were

[55:53] already an employee in the company and

[55:55] you will have a very good sense of

[55:57] culturally how they are you know are you

[55:59] in the same wavelength can they actually

[56:00] do a good job at this the kind of stuff

[56:02] especially pick the things that are not

[56:03] working right now in your company

[56:04] because that's those are the things you

[56:05] would give them to fix when they come in

[56:07] and if they could fix those things

[56:08] they're clearly a good hire uh so I'd

[56:11] rather do that then coming in in an

[56:13] interview and just asking them you know

[56:16] the you know the gotcha questions that

[56:18] they might have practiced you know tell

[56:19] me your own weakness what's your biggest

[56:21] weakness and so on um so that's that's

[56:23] one of the big things that uh we do the

[56:25] other is back doors and I believe you

[56:27] should do the back doors up front so

[56:30] don't go through a lot of firms

[56:32] especially recruiting firms they will do

[56:34] run you through a cycle they have you

[56:36] meet all these people and then at the

[56:37] end they want to just check the box by

[56:39] way they'll even do the references for

[56:40] you uh which is a big mistake I think

[56:43] you should references up front I already

[56:45] know who you're hiring uh so that the

[56:47] first time I meet the person I already

[56:48] know a lot about them I've already asked

[56:51] and I've also found this thing that if

[56:52] you do five to 10 back doors on people

[56:54] their bosses previous bosses say you

[56:57] actually kind of know the person better

[56:58] in some regards not in their full

[57:00] entirety better than they know

[57:02] themselves cuz you know all the things

[57:03] they went through and you know the

[57:04] perspective of three four people that

[57:06] saw that happen to them in the previous

[57:07] job they might not actually fully

[57:09] comprehend what everybody thought about

[57:11] that situation of course they have a

[57:12] unique perspective so I think that back

[57:14] doors are extremely important um you

[57:16] know and then others just look at their

[57:17] trajectory of work you know where were

[57:19] they have they seen great have they done

[57:20] something Stellar are they hopping

[57:22] around a lot um you know those are the

[57:24] three things that we kind of emphasize

[57:26] in hiring what are your techniques on

[57:27] the back door references uh are there

[57:29] are there specific questions you like to

[57:31] ask or ways that no one likes to talk

[57:33] poorly about someone they know so how do

[57:36] you sort of drill in to make sure you're

[57:37] getting the actual high quality

[57:39] information it really depends on who

[57:40] you're talking to and they're all

[57:41] different you can tell immediately some

[57:42] people are not just going to tell you

[57:43] the truth this is going to be you know

[57:45] they're going to just say good things or

[57:47] they don't want to say anything so you

[57:48] know that's that so you just move on and

[57:50] end the call uh but uh and I guess I'm

[57:52] revealing my uh you know uh recipe here

[57:55] so it will never work again but um I

[57:58] think that if you can find the former

[58:00] person that you know opens up I think

[58:02] one thing that I like to grill them on

[58:04] is really really ranking of how good the

[58:06] person is and don't ask you know score

[58:08] from one to 10 and they say 10 really

[58:10] ask them like does it rank number one

[58:11] number two how many have you and then

[58:13] want go really deep who did you who's

[58:15] number one who's number two on your list

[58:16] by the way you go after those as well of

[58:17] course and then it really ask them you

[58:19] know go through scenarios like it's just

[58:21] the follow-up questions like what what

[58:22] did they do well tell me something that

[58:24] went wrong give me a scenario what was

[58:26] that scenario really push the boundary

[58:28] you got kind of almost to the point that

[58:30] they become uncomfortable so many times

[58:32] I've done it so far that you know they

[58:33] call back and say like you know this is

[58:35] you know what's going on here uh but

[58:37] yeah you want to but you'll find when

[58:39] you're doing the back doors that okay

[58:40] that guy and that gal they're like super

[58:43] forthcoming that's a straight shooter

[58:44] they're going to tell you the whole

[58:45] thing and others are not front door

[58:47] references the references that the

[58:48] candidate gives you uh are similar but

[58:51] kind of inverted they you know the vast

[58:53] majority are actually people that the

[58:55] person is going to hire next if it's a

[58:57] manager they're just literally giving

[58:58] you their and that's useful too because

[59:00] you can interview those people you know

[59:01] who they're going to hire next so you

[59:02] can gauge the quality of the people that

[59:04] they're going to hire but occasionally

[59:06] you find the front door that also tells

[59:07] you the real truth and tells you like

[59:09] really what's going on um and you learn

[59:11] a lot there too uh and when I do these

[59:14] references I'm not looking for hey

[59:15] what's your one fault that I'm going to

[59:17] cancel you know the I'm not going to

[59:18] hire you for it's just to get a complete

[59:20] picture you're going to have fault

[59:21] you're going to have strength you want

[59:22] to understand that full picture uh

[59:24] before we go ahead and hire you um so

[59:26] that's kind of what we're going for but

[59:27] yeah for some execs I've done 15 of

[59:29] these back doors before I hired them for

[59:32] from a uh as a leader you've had to ramp

[59:34] up in different functional areas one of

[59:36] which was Enterprise sales I don't think

[59:38] you had experience to it how how did you

[59:40] go about learning in that area and I

[59:42] think you copied maybe best practices or

[59:45] sort of internalized stitch together to

[59:47] build your own model from a bunch of

[59:48] different organizations maybe you can

[59:50] you talk through learning a new area or

[59:51] discipline and how you went about it

[59:53] yeah I mean first of all I would just

[59:53] say you know we hired Ron gisco who you

[59:55] know took us from essentially zero to

[59:58] now over two billion AR right B

[60:00] basically three billion AR um and so

[60:03] he's been phenomenal and and what did

[60:05] you see in him or yeah

[60:07] um I thought that he was extremely smart

[60:10] so I thought he's actually different

[60:12] from many of the sales people he is the

[60:13] classical Enterprise B2B sales guy you

[60:16] know so he's not like the engineer type

[60:18] that's you know he is the classic

[60:21] archetype of a sales leader you know

[60:24] with all the raw raw and motivational

[60:26] speech and get everybody riled up so

[60:28] it's like he has all that so that's

[60:30] great that's the stuff we didn't

[60:31] understand or have he had the big

[60:34] Enterprise experience because there's

[60:35] all sellers that sell to be to midmarket

[60:37] S&B but he had actually sold to really

[60:39] big gigantic Enterprises so that's also

[60:41] something we didn't understand anything

[60:42] about like he was thinking very big like

[60:44] when he came in you know he's like we're

[60:46] going to do a $10 million contract or

[60:47] 100 million we were like this no one's G

[60:49] to ever pay $10 million for datx it was

[60:51] our mindset so that was also useful but

[60:54] um but he also was

[60:56] um you know he was cerebral and he was

[60:59] um extremely smart and went by first

[61:01] principal so there was a compatibility

[61:02] he had an engineering degree so he was

[61:04] sort of the unicorn of kind of someone

[61:07] who like spoke our language and couldn't

[61:09] understand us and was extremely smart

[61:10] but also had this whole other thing that

[61:12] we we couldn't understand um so that

[61:15] hire was important we took us a year to

[61:17] hire we went through a lot of candidates

[61:19] and I think we kind of nailed that one

[61:21] it was luck um so that's important um

[61:24] the other thing I would say is in in in

[61:26] the interview process when you're

[61:27] searching like we took us a year to hire

[61:29] a

[61:30] salesperson um take the I've seen people

[61:32] make this mistake take the exact hiring

[61:35] process super seriously um it's a

[61:38] learning process you're basically going

[61:40] to school to learn what head of sales

[61:42] look like so in that talk to all the top

[61:45] head of sales and Grill them and pay

[61:48] attention and use them also in the

[61:49] interview since I don't believe in

[61:50] interviews as I said use the interviews

[61:52] a little bit of a tutorial for yourself

[61:54] to learn how does excellent sales look

[61:56] like in your organization for your

[61:57] company for your company for your

[61:58] company and you get the after you know

[62:01] talking to 20 people you get a pretty

[62:04] good picture of okay this is kind of it

[62:05] this is what they're doing they all have

[62:07] that all the Stellar ones seem to have

[62:08] this in common uh this is what it's

[62:10] about and you can go deeper and then in

[62:12] the backd door process you figure out

[62:14] who's who you figure out who are the top

[62:16] people in this industry that you can't

[62:17] hire try to get some time with them as

[62:19] well to just learn from them and build a

[62:21] relationship with them or get them to be

[62:22] advisers so really put yourself in the

[62:25] hey you're going to University to learn

[62:26] um that's that's what that process is

[62:29] you know you're not an expert and Trust

[62:31] the people that are the best in the

[62:33] industry at that trying to find the

[62:34] number one person and go with them in

[62:37] hiring for data breaks um are there

[62:40] certain things that you feel you

[62:42] uniquely prioritize or the types of

[62:45] people that succeed within the

[62:46] organization that are is maybe unique to

[62:49] data bricks yeah well so our culture

[62:50] principles have been reverse engineer to

[62:52] exactly answer your question so you

[62:54] didn't start with the principles and

[62:55] went the other way you start started

[62:56] with the people that succeeded and came

[62:57] back succeeded and failed okay we also

[62:59] looked at people that had perfect CVS

[63:01] that we hired and they bombed out why

[63:04] was that and we went back and said okay

[63:05] we couldn't agree on the hiring bar they

[63:07] were like I've worked with these 10

[63:09] people they're stellar and we're like no

[63:10] that doesn't look like the our bar that

[63:13] was big issue so raise the bar don't

[63:15] settle we'd rather have more uh you know

[63:19] we'd rather have more false negatives uh

[63:22] than have false positives so we'd rather

[63:23] reject someone that's really great by

[63:25] mistake then hire someone by mistake

[63:27] that's not great and that's painful um

[63:30] we learned that that way truth seeking a

[63:32] lot of exacts from the big companies had

[63:34] this attitude of um you know uh

[63:38] everything's going great I got this my

[63:40] team's got that we're working on this

[63:41] here's a nice slide deck manage up

[63:43] nothing to look for here um but um that

[63:47] didn't work for us it's like that's what

[63:49] where the TR seeking principle came in

[63:51] we really need to know like what's

[63:52] broken who did you who in your team is

[63:54] not working out well what's not what are

[63:55] we not doing well where are we not

[63:57] satisfying the customers so that was the

[63:58] second principles um you know third

[64:00] principle I've done this before I know

[64:02] how it's done this is how much bigger

[64:04] better company's doing it we should do

[64:05] it this way so that was not first

[64:07] principles we needed to know exactly how

[64:09] and why and go from first principles on

[64:11] every decision so um so being first

[64:14] principal became another culture

[64:15] principal so our culture principles are

[64:17] the recipe for succeeding at data bricks

[64:19] like exec asked me all the time at the

[64:21] end you know before just we shake hands

[64:23] and I hire them they say hey so do you

[64:24] think I'm going to be successful here

[64:25] what you think is going to be needed I

[64:26] it's like it's super simple I swear to

[64:28] God read the culture principles if you

[64:30] really do those you will be I mean of

[64:32] course the results have to the output

[64:34] has to be great but you will work out

[64:35] here if any of this stuff doesn't look

[64:38] good to you let's argue about it now

[64:39] because that's that's going to be an

[64:40] issue those are really the principles of

[64:42] the company so our culture principles

[64:44] aren't like the aspirational cool stuff

[64:46] that you'd like to have on the wall it's

[64:48] literally what worked and didn't work in

[64:49] the past empirically when when um when

[64:52] looking for people within uh or to come

[64:54] in data breaks I think people that have

[64:56] a chip on their shoulder a little bit um

[64:58] do you is that something you can do you

[65:01] try to tease out in the conversations

[65:02] what are the types of uh things that

[65:04] you'll ask to try to figure that out

[65:06] yeah I mean the people that you know

[65:07] really really really went Against All

[65:09] Odds really pushed they have grit one of

[65:11] the things that Ron said in the sales uh

[65:14] you know interview that kind of I

[65:15] remember now from 2015 I think November

[65:19] was he said hey if if there's a deal

[65:22] lost you know I want to know like cuz

[65:26] no way anyone else on the planet could

[65:28] have won that deal like I just know it's

[65:30] humanly impossible cuz I will have done

[65:33] everything humanly possible to win that

[65:35] deal so I just want and it was a side

[65:38] comment he was doing with something and

[65:39] it was like clear to him that this this

[65:41] guy is's going to go over and Beyond and

[65:44] then of course the negotiation with him

[65:45] to hire him was a real pain so that was

[65:48] also reaffirming that okay he's probably

[65:50] going to be great at this job uh you

[65:52] don't want to of sales that you know

[65:54] terrible at negotiating they own comp

[65:56] for themselves um so you know you want

[65:59] to sus out you know is there something

[66:01] something that the people who have

[66:02] something to prove are they trying to

[66:04] prove to you if they're super content

[66:07] and happy with things you know then it's

[66:10] probably not going to work it's probably

[66:12] for people that are a little bit broken

[66:13] like all of us are like we are all we

[66:15] have something to prove and we're going

[66:16] to work our ass off going to do

[66:18] everything in our power and um you can

[66:20] sus that out in interviews it's not hard

[66:22] you mentioned work your ass off there I

[66:24] uh that's something that I think has

[66:26] went out of Vogue working hard for a

[66:28] while it's sort of come back in Vogue

[66:30] I'm curious you had said something along

[66:32] the lines I had here you never met

[66:33] someone successful who didn't work hard

[66:35] can you elaborate on on that point in

[66:37] research in Academia like genius

[66:39] professors you know who had one amazing

[66:41] Awards you know and that's like you know

[66:43] you can be really really smart in

[66:45] research and maybe you don't need to

[66:45] work hard but all of them that I met

[66:48] they were you know working harder than

[66:50] us and we're like shocked they're there

[66:52] 247 and then in Industry the same thing

[66:54] so I just never ever met someone who's

[66:56] just phoning it in and they're super

[66:58] successful you find talented people but

[66:59] they're not successful it's it has to go

[67:02] with extremely hard work so we had that

[67:04] from day one at data breaks and we never

[67:05] deviated whether it was in Vogue or not

[67:07] we were super hardworking culture from

[67:09] day one we contined to be and we said

[67:11] look we have lofty goals to achieve them

[67:14] we're going to work extremely hard

[67:15] totally understandable if you don't want

[67:16] to do it because maybe you have family

[67:18] maybe other things you want to do in

[67:19] life that's totally understandable but

[67:21] then probably databook is not for you so

[67:23] it's been always always true here at at

[67:26] in fact we had um you know our work life

[67:29] balance scores weren't great in surveys

[67:31] and you know I try to be upfront we

[67:33] don't want to actually have terrible

[67:34] work life balance we actually focus on

[67:36] teams that had terrible scores and try

[67:37] to up you know change things and we got

[67:39] actually improvements in those teams but

[67:41] I also was upfront I don't want to be

[67:42] best in class and have the highest work

[67:44] life balance score in the industry

[67:45] that's not we're not going to win that

[67:48] way um so that it's as simple as that

[67:52] now I Tred to myself also match that so

[67:54] I don't want anyone to work harder than

[67:55] me like so I got to kind of match that

[67:58] myself um but and it has to be

[68:00] sustainable what I mean by that is I've

[68:02] been doing this for decade more uh and I

[68:04] want it to be the same way for the

[68:05] employees so if they're like really

[68:07] burning themselves out and they can't do

[68:09] it for many more years that's not I

[68:10] don't want them to do that I want them

[68:11] to be able to do it and it's sustainable

[68:14] uh and then hopefully we can achieve

[68:16] great things together and if they don't

[68:17] that's okay too um no hard feelings um

[68:20] you know or maybe in a period of their

[68:21] life they want to do it but they don't

[68:22] want to do it another that's okay too

[68:24] one of the hardest things are companies

[68:25] deal with and scaling is when the the

[68:28] the people that got you there they're

[68:30] starting to question if they're the ones

[68:31] that can get you there to the next step

[68:33] along the journey sounds like when you

[68:34] came in you you made that decision as

[68:36] CEO to uplevel a lot of leadership and

[68:38] I'm sure along the way you've you've

[68:40] kept Ron and he's continued to scale in

[68:42] his role but I'm sure there's other

[68:43] functional areas that you've decided to

[68:45] upgrade um how have you gone about

[68:47] making the decision that hey it might be

[68:49] time to part with someone who who's done

[68:51] a great job up to that point but you

[68:53] might need someone new to take you to

[68:54] the next level I think you have to just

[68:56] be truth secking with yourself so number

[68:57] one is like when do you know yourself

[68:58] that you know I think we kind of know

[69:00] there's the signals but we just don't

[69:01] want to see the truth we want to ignore

[69:03] it because it's it's so hard because

[69:05] this person helped build the company

[69:06] with you it's so you don't want to kind

[69:08] of admit it to yourself but there's deep

[69:11] inside you know deep deep deep deep

[69:12] inside so just immediately when that is

[69:14] there just recognize it and face the

[69:16] truth be truth seeking with yourself

[69:18] don't light yourself at least as an exec

[69:20] okay once you know it yourself now you

[69:22] have to take action I found it easiest

[69:24] if you can explain to the person and get

[69:25] them on board it's not really working

[69:27] don't make it about like just make it

[69:29] like is it working or not is are you

[69:31] winning or not here are you winning or

[69:33] not just focus on that and if they

[69:34] realize that hey okay I am not winning

[69:36] well let's discuss why then I think

[69:38] everything else becomes much simpler

[69:40] it's like okay but then what do we do

[69:41] about what about you then so after you

[69:43] know like okay I'm not winning it's not

[69:44] quite working there are many reasons

[69:46] okay let's figure out a way to make this

[69:47] work then you can change steer the

[69:49] conversation towards okay what's the

[69:51] best thing for you your career I want to

[69:53] help you I want you to be successful I

[69:55] have found that there are new roles for

[69:56] people where they can continue to crush

[69:58] it I have had people that you know they

[70:01] in that role it wasn't working anymore

[70:04] and we found a new person that leads it

[70:06] or you know you do the layering or

[70:08] whatever but you find a new role for

[70:09] this person and they crush it and

[70:11] they're awesome at it and they'll be

[70:12] happier actually you know after a while

[70:14] goes on they'll be like hey Ali's no

[70:16] longer bugging me you know about it not

[70:19] working second I'm actually happier when

[70:21] I'm succeeding when I'm winning I'm

[70:23] happier than when I'm constantly it's

[70:24] not working and everything is going you

[70:26] know I'm having a bad day every day so

[70:28] I've actually found that many of those

[70:29] folks you can keep them in the company

[70:31] uh but you should also part ways if

[70:32] they're like just phoning it in and

[70:34] they're not interested anymore and

[70:35] they're just there for some memory of

[70:37] what happened in the early days when

[70:38] everything was great it's you better off

[70:41] also parting ways too let's not waste

[70:42] their time and our time maybe zooming

[70:45] back out as we uh as as we wrap um as if

[70:50] someone's listening to this in a couple

[70:51] years time and we're sort of looking

[70:52] forward with your crystal ball that you

[70:54] claim not to have but I think you're

[70:55] pretty good on it um are there are there

[70:58] elements of um the world around data

[71:01] bricks or what you guys are operating

[71:04] that you you think are on the cusp of

[71:08] being possible in the next five years

[71:10] just things that get you really excited

[71:12] to get out of bed every day and do this

[71:14] job and just the potential maybe at an

[71:15] industry level not even at a company

[71:17] level that you think we're on the cusp

[71:19] of seeing yeah I think what's going to

[71:21] happen is that we're going to see many

[71:22] of the things that we see today are

[71:24] going to be rupted and there's going to

[71:26] be a sort of AI app for those things in

[71:28] the future we don't even know what

[71:30] they're going to look like you know but

[71:32] um what are they all need at their core

[71:35] like what did apps need in the last 10

[71:37] 20 30 40 years they needed an Oracle

[71:38] database under the hood you know the

[71:40] joke is like you put all the complex you

[71:42] stuff all the complexity into a database

[71:44] and then do you build workflows and UI

[71:46] on top or the two-tiered or three-

[71:47] tiered model um I think in the future

[71:50] you need the AI database under the hood

[71:52] and if you have ai database you have all

[71:54] your transactional data you have all

[71:56] your analytics and AI in there with the

[71:58] model and then you can do wonders on top

[72:01] so I I think we're going to see an

[72:02] ecosystem of these applications in the

[72:05] AI space being built and they all need

[72:08] an AI database under the hood and that's

[72:10] what basically datab is datx is

[72:11] basically AI database we don't call it

[72:13] that we don't Market it that way but

[72:14] essentially it's an AI database under

[72:15] the hood and you will need that for

[72:17] every application every company in the

[72:19] planet will need that and you know I

[72:21] hope that we can be the company that

[72:22] powers all of these applications in the

[72:24] future there others also that do that as

[72:26] well um but um that's that's the goal

[72:29] and I think you know we're seeing

[72:31] already the seeds of this happening the

[72:33] seeds of it I guess I'm curious just to

[72:34] elaborate on that like the seeds of this

[72:36] happening are you seeing just

[72:38] particularly exciting use cases or just

[72:40] customers look there's a lot look in the

[72:44] same space they need to do massive log

[72:46] processing securely and detect zero day

[72:49] attacks okay sounds that's like kind of

[72:51] what data briak spread and butter is

[72:52] real-time processing of massive Logs

[72:54] with I built in in the observability

[72:56] space same thing you need to observe you

[72:58] know your log processing get you know

[73:01] understand the metrics detect anomalies

[73:03] and so on in the customer 360 space you

[73:05] know cdps and you know understanding

[73:08] what your customers are doing same thing

[73:09] again there it's like you know massive

[73:11] data that you have to collect from many

[73:13] many different places and then get

[73:14] Telemetry on it it's huge data

[73:16] processing you need to do it in real

[73:18] time you need to do AI to get the

[73:19] insights and doing those so each one of

[73:21] these spaces I think are going to be

[73:23] built on basically a AI database I hope

[73:25] we can be the AI database that powers

[73:27] all of them uh this disruption I think

[73:29] is going to happen in the next two three

[73:30] four years it's exciting well thank you

[73:32] for doing this

[73:35] likewise thank you for joining this

[73:37] episode of the Logan Bartlett show with
